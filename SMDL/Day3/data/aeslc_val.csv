"
1,"Phillip;  Could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for Bishops Corner.
I was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it I should just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.
Also, I need the vendor payee list that you created for the Land and Soft costs.
I need to re-format it by draw number and to the Bank One format, and again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.
Please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers to see if you agree.
Land And Soft Costs 	- 	Initial Draw	$	  1,608,683.05 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 1	$	     250,000.00 					Galaxy			-	Draw # 2	$	     223,259.09  						Total Paid To Date Cash		$	  2,081,942.14  					Project Cost					$	10,740,980.87 					Loan Amount					$	  8,055,736.65  					Equity Required				$	  2,685,244.22 					Developer Profit					$	 (   326,202.57)  						Balance Of Funding			$	  2,359,041.65  						Total Paid To Date			$	  2,081,942.14  						Balance To Fund Cash			$	     277,099.51   					Galaxy			-	Draw # 3	$	     467,566.66  						Bank One Draw # 1			$	     190,467.15 						Final Cash Funding			$	     277,099.51   I think you thought you had more to fund.
However, I do not see that you accounted for the cash portion of the Developer fee that you paid CIS.
Am I looking at this right?
Please let me know and attach?
the files discussed above.
I am working all day Monday so I hope I can get it before then if possible.
Thanks A Lot

5,"John - you may have already heard this but on Friday, NYMEX increased margins for clearing brokers posting for Enron by 50%.
Also Soc Gen cancelled their margin line on Friday (Warren wants to make it very clear that it was Soc Gen and not Fimat.)
So far, Fimat is not reducing its trading limit with us but is passing through the NYMEX requirement.
All of our brokers will have the right to do this and I expect them to do so.

6,"Tracy called me at work.
A water pipe broke under the street between her house and the old Hamilton house.
She said water was shooting everywhere and that they were to turn off the water for at least 5 hours.
Well, they worked fast because when I got home at 6:00, I had water.
So I made some turkey soup.
But Willow Lane will be torn up for a while as it just buckled the cement.
The hole was about 7 feet down according to Tracy.
Good thing this didn't happen on Thanksgiving!
I have a foundation man coming out next week to check the foundation.
Tracy seems to have a similar problem.
Maybe we can get a two for one deal.
John, I need your book list at Amazon.com this week.
No excuses!
Oh, tell Jeannie that I finished her soup this evening for dinner.
She's a good cook!
Have a good week guys.

Also, I see that Enron and Dynegy have been negotiating for days.....this concerns me.
they cannot seem to come up with a new price.

9,"Russell: I think I should give you a little background on small ventures.
Bill  Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship.
He is an  extremely creative individual.
Whalley actually commented on him today as  someone ""who thinks outside the box"".
Bill actually sat in a bar four years  and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.
He has been  successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.
As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron.
He throws out  ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one.
He pointed  out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally  don't follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for  Enron.
In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within  reason.
I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be  considered a high priority.
I am willing to accept some of the credit risk  exposure as a cost of doing business.
Bill understands his role as an  independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for  someone with finite capital.
I place very high confidence in Bill not  conducting high risk trades.
Having said that, we certainly need to monitor  his credit exposure and continue to require LC's.
Just understand that he is  at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade  counterparty.
I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread  option he traded.
He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the  trading desk, knew it as well.
There are a couple isolated products that  Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.
This  was one product.
Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing  models created by the research group.
The problem with these models is that  they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental  price limitations.
For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible,  for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within  variable cost than the models predict.
Thus it is necessary to apply a  correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.
Obviously,  we have this function in our pricing models.
I was not aware this  methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.
This has since  been changed.
Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very  few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.
Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to  Enron.
I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting  credit.
I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade  considering the circumstances.
If you believe differently, please advise.
Thanks,

13,"Hi Folks,  Another wild week in the NFL.
We've got Footballguy Scott Luebke's Week 7 Upgrade - Downgrade - Waiver Wire Picks.
Before we get to that though, let me throw out something I posted today on our message boards regarding owners who beat themselves up second guessing themselves.
This season has been as tough to predict as any in recent memory and I thought this might be something some of you might need to hear.
From our Message Boards www.footballguystalk.com  One of our message board members was (justifiably) frustrated with watching Trung Canidate blow up on his bench while Ahman Green and Ricky Williams fared less well as his starters.
My reply to him:  Don't be down on yourself.
That's the nature of the game.
There is no way you bench Ricky Williams or Ahman Green for Canidate when Canidate was such a question mark last week.
You did what just about every one of us would have done I'm guessing.
It's part of the game.
Is it frustrating?
Sure it is.
But it's still part of the game.
In my local league last week, I took a chance again on Antonio Freeman after starting him for the first few weeks (but not week 5 - Aargh... )   Did it play out?
No, it didn't.
I had guys on my bench who outscored him.
But looking back on everything I knew with Minnesota and Billy Schroeder, it was the right call for me.
I learned a long time ago the secret to Fantasy Football.
You just have to take the best info you can assemble, make your call and let the players do the rest.
Just like a real GM.
You can only do so much.
If you got beat because you didn't know Terry Glenn was out and you started him, well, that's your bad.
But if you got beat because Trung Canidate decided to play the game of his life, and proven RBs Williams and Green did not, well, that's not your fault.
I promise you, if you can predict things to that degree, you need to quit your job and head to Vegas.
Control what you can control.
Bust your butt to know all you can know.
Make the best decisions you can make and be comfortable you've done all you can do.
After that, just enjoy the games.
Trust me, you'll be a better owner because of it.
Ok, let's jump to Scott's report for this week.
Have a great week, everyone.
Joe  /**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/**/   Upgrades   QB - Tom Brady (Waiver Wire) - 5 touchdown passes in the last 2 weeks deserves an upgrade in my book.
More importantly, Brady has yet to throw an interception this season.
When Bledsoe returns from injury, the Patriots' coaching staff will have a very difficult decision to make.
There's even some talk that Bledsoe might not return this season.
Right now, Brady deserves a pickup by any fantasy team needing a quarterback.
QB - Tim Couch - The yardage numbers won't win any awards, but the 4 touchdowns in the last 2 games is impressive.
Couch is starting to show signs of becoming a very good quarterback in this league.
Keep in mind, a tough schedule looms ahead for Couch.
However, with the Browns offense improving, he should be considered a top quarterback for teams in a keeper league looking towards the future.
QB - Doug Flutie - The Flutie magic continues to strike.
He's not the best fantasy quarterback, but numerous fantasy teams can be aided by inserting Flutie into the lineup.
With Curtis Conway and Jeff Graham staying healthy, Flutie should be considered a top 15 quarterback this season.
With a strong rushing game keeping defenses honest, look for Flutie to post numbers similar to Sunday on occasion.
280 passing yards and 2 scores is respectable against a tough Denver defense.
RB - Anthony Thomas -The A-Train continues to ride into fantasy starting

14,"this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.
A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999, and the early morning hours of Sunday, December 5, 1999: 6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and Texas Fight at full-freaking blast 6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels  7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the FIRST tee-time of the morning) 8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer) 8:53 Crack open second beer 8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea) 10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as beers), sign scorecard for smoooooth 95 10:35 Headed for San Antonio 10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and post-game festivities 11:10 We decide we don't have enough booze, so we double-back to a liquor store and buy the good ol' 750 ml plastic bottle ""Traveler"" Jim Beam 11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day.
Not a single cloud in the sky.
About 70 degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
We're on the second floor of a two-story parking garage on the corner (a couple hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like wildmen.
The band doubles back to the street right below us and serenades us with Texas Fight and The Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the way to the Alamodome.
Again, we hoot and holler like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops right below us to serenade us, this time, however, with the Nebraska fight songs.
Although somewhat impressed by their spirit and verve, we remain convinced that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the ""Traveler"" and 11 cans of beer into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans.
They are taunting me.
I am taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play what I now call and will forever be remembered as ""Cell-Phone Flop Out.""
Remember flop out for a dollar?
The rules are similar.
I tell this Nebraska jackass that if he's so confident in his team, he should ""flop out"" his cell phone RIGHT NOW and make plane reservations to Phoenix for the Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words: ""And not those damn refundable tickets, either!
You request those non-refundable, non-transferrable sons-of-bitches!""
He backs down.
He is unworthy.
I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable and non-transferrable.
Price: $712.
He is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame.
I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas fans.
I am KING and these are my subjects.
I distribute the 11 beers in my pants to the cheering masses.
I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff.
Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast.
Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards total offense for Texas.
Zero first downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit.
I pour another stiffy from the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.
I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.
While I am standing in line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of the end zone.
Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0.
I wish I had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom: ""Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock.""
He is unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants.
I share my beer with two high school girls sitting behind me.
Surprisingly, they are equipped with a flask full of vodka.
I send them off to purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may consume their vodka.
I have not lost faith.
Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
4:51 No more vodka.
The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.
I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0.
I am beginning to lose faith.
This normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: ""I'm sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and are non-refundable and non-transferrable.""
5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession counter.
As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when there is less than 10 minutes on the game clock.
I am enraged by this policy.
I ask loudly: ""Why the fuck didn't you announce last call over the fucking PA system??!!""
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat.
All of a sudden, the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.
""Whazzis?,"" I mutter, awaking from my coma, ""Iz we winnig?
Did wez scort?""
Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters ""S"", ""K"", and ""A"" in the ""Nebraska"" spelled out in their end zone.
I cheer wildly.
I pick up the empty Traveler bottle and stick my tongue in it.
I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck.
I would taunt them with some off-color remarks about their parentage, but I am too drunk to form complete sentences.
With my last cognitive thought of the evening, I take solace in the fact that if we had not beaten them in October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship.
6:30 Back in the car.
On the way back to Austin for the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off.
We can still salvage the day!
I crack open a beer.
It is warm.
I don't care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas.
I am hungry.
I go inside the store.
I walk past the beer frig.
I notice a Zima.
I've never had a Zima.
I wonder if it's any good.
I pull a Zima from the frig.
I twist the top off and drink the Zima in three swallows.
Zima sucks.
I replace the empty bottle in the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store.
I walk to where the ingredients are, where the person usually makes the sub.
There is no one there.
I lean over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives.
I eat them.
I am still hungry.
I lean further over the counter and grab approximately two pounds of Pastrami.
I walk out of the store grunting and eating Pastrami.
The patrons in the store fear me.
I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin.
I have been drinking warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour.
My truck-mate is tired of my singing.
He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good songs besides ""You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"" and ""Neon Moon"" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times each was a bit excessive.
Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD play on its own.
I tell him to fuck off and restart ""Neon Moon.""
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center.
My truckmate, against my loud and profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage.
I tell him he's an idiot.
I tell him we will never get out.
I tell him we may as well pitch a fucking tent here.
He ignores me.
I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes.
I whistle ""Neon Moon"" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying.
I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants.
We're going to kick the shit out of Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29.
I am pleased.
I go to the bathroom to pee for the 67th time today.
I giggle to myself because of the new opportunity to do ""the bathroom Brice.""
There are no Arizona fans in the bathroom.
I am disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a ""Niiiiiice cock.""
No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can.
Needless to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center, much less Bud Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: ""Where did you get that, sir?""
I tell him (no shit): ""Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little plastic footballs.
Would you mind throwing this away for me?""
I take the last swig and hand it to him.
He is confused.
I pretend I'm going to the bathroom, but I run away giggling instead.
I duck into some entrance to avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people and sit down.
The usher walks by harmlessly.
I am giggling like a little girl.
I crack open another can of Bud Light.
9:52 I am lost.
In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings.
I have no ticket stub.
I cannot find my seats.
Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs.
I am enraged.
I have cleared out the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the surrounding chairs with it.
A concerned fan asks if I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive ""worst fucking call I have EVER seen,"" I attempt to remove my hat again to begin beating inanimate objects.
However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter inch gash over my eye.
I am now bleeding into my left eye and all over my shirt.
""Perhaps,"" I think to myself, ""I'm taking this a bit seriously.""
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing.
I'm so drunk I am swaying and grunting.
I have a bloody napkin pressed on my left eye.
My pants are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt wrapped around my waist.
I look like I should be in an episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost.
I put my bloody white shirt back on my body and make my way for the exits.
I am stopped every 20 seconds by a good samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me why I am covered in blood, but I merely grunt incoherently and keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have located the parking garage.
I walk up six flights of stairs, promise that when I see my friend I will punch him in the face for making me walk up six flights of stairs, find the truck, and collapse in a heap in the bed of the truck.
I look around and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap.
I see my friend in the driver's seat.
I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I am too tired to punch my friend.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:31 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:38 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:47 I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is lined up all the way around the garage, six whole flights, and no one is moving.
I call my friend a ""Stupid fuck.""
11:58 I am jostled.
The truck is moving.
I lift my head to look out the bed of the truck and notice that traffic is beginning to move on the second floor.
I jump out of the truck, walk to the edge of the parking facility, and pee off the sixth floor onto the street below.
My friend looks at me like I just anally violated his minor sister.
I turn around and pee on the front of his truck while singing the lyrics to ""Neon Moon.""
12:11 We are moving.
We are out of beer.
I jump from the truck and go from vehicle to vehicle until someone gives me two beers.
I am happy.
I return to my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking facility.
We make our way to my apartment and find Ed sitting on the couch with a freshly opened bottle of Glenlivet on the coffee table in front of him.
We are all going to die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters of the bottle of Glenlivet.
We decide it would be a wonderful idea to go dancing at PollyEsther's.
Ed has to pee.
He walks down the hall to our apartment and directly into the full length mirror at the end of the hall, smashing it into hundreds of pieces.
We giggle uncontrollably and leave for PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs uncontrollably at our efforts to enter his club.
""Fellas,"" he says in between his fits of spastic laughter, ""I've been working this door for almost a year.
I've been working doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can honestly say that I ain't never seen three drunker mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you in.""
We attempt to reason with him.
He laughs harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in.
We take two steps in the door and hear ""Last call for alcohol!""
I turn to the group and mutter: ""See, dat wasn't that fuckin' hard.
Day don't fuckin' do that at the Awamo...the awaom...the alab...fuck it, that stadium we was at today..."" We order 6 shots of tequila and three beers.
2:15 Back on the street.
We need food.
We hail a cab to take us the two and one half blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60.
We give him $10 and tell him to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait.
We give the hostess $50.
We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried pickles, a Cobb salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of Blueberry blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a hamburger, two cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of fries, and an order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives.
We are all asleep with our heads on the table.
The waiter wakes us up.
We eat every fucking bit of our food.
Most of the restaurant patrons around us are disgusted.
We don't give a shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the bartender at Katz's.
She is not pretty.

Americans have given of themselves, sacrificing to help others and showing the spirit of love and sharing that is so much a part of the Christmas season.
According to the Gospel of Luke, two thousand years ago, the savior of mankind came into the world.
Christians believe that Jesus' birth was the incarnation of God on earth, opening the door to new hope and eternal life.
At Christmastime, Christians celebrate God's love revealed to the world through Christ.
And the message of Jesus is one that all Americans can embrace this holiday season -- to love one another.

Also there is now a folder near the MAPP printer (between Dean and Don) that will include all the nightly faxes and load sheets.
The folder will help us keep track of what has been faxed in case EES trans calls complaining.
The load sheets are needed for the daily forecasting expained in the SOP 13 Dean sent out last week.
In the folder there are extra copies of the SOP 13 in case you want it as well as GENCO phone numbers in case Allegheny calls.
Hopefully this will help create some consistency on nights and provide the day people access to the MDEA load sheets.

39,"Dear NewCo employees: =20 I wanted to send a note giving you my views on the NewCo opportunity and ne= xt steps.=20 =20 What are those opportunities?
In short, to date no competitor has taken En= ron's dominant market position.
In most cases, competitiors are retrenchin= g from an aggressive expansion of their deregulated business in order to pr= otect their key regulated franchises or balance sheets.
Market liquidity an= d activity is extremely fractured and highly diminished from 2000 levels.
= This will create opportunities as bid/offers expand and customers have less=  choices to manage key long-term risks.
This lack of transparancy and liqui= dity will also provide numerous opportunities, in the commodity, asset and = capital markets, to take advantage of key arbitrages across the North Ameri= can grid.
We are faced with an energy asset overhang, in the short run, w= hich is unprecedented since the early nineties.
This coupled with market p= articipants selling assets to protect balance sheets will provide many oppo= rtunities to acquire attractive energy assets at good value.
However, in th= e long-run, as we emerge from the recession and as highly energy intensive = technology investment resumes, increasing asset values, demand for energy a= nd energy price volatility are highly likely.
On the services side, there a= re numerous un-met needs in the market place at this point including demand=  side management, distributed generation amongst others that only Enron peo= ple have the complete value chain understanding to make feasible.
I also be= lieve that innovation in the energy capital markets can provide value to Ne= wCo and our customers given the blight of liquidity in capital markets.
In = short, we are at the eve of an opportunity in the energy markets which has = not been seen since the early nineties.
=20 What is NewCo?
NewCo will be a private company that will focus on the ener= gy merchant business in North America which will capitalize on the opportun= ities detailed above.
These businesses will stretch from production to mar= ket, wholesale through retail primarily in natural gas and electricity in t= he United States and Canada.
It will be a portfolio of several key business= es, services and assets supported by a common infrastructure.
It will be m= ajority owned by Enron but will have significant outside investment to ensu= re liquidity and legitimacy.
It will be re-branded and be operating and sol= vent by mid Q2 at the latest.
It will be seeded with a number of Enron ass= ets and contracts that we think add value to our business or provide key cr= edit support.
Those assets are conservatively valued at approximately $500 = million to one billion.
With asset and new cash investment, NewCo should be=  at least a billion dollar company.
It will emerge as a non-debtor company = and should be an investment grade rated company.
NewCo will employ approxim= ately 100 to 200 people depending on the mix of businesses and assets under=  control.
These people will be sourced from the existing pool of talent in=  Enron and ex-employees.
NewCo will have access to all Enron's existing sys= tems and infrastructure.
It will be in the market of buying and selling ene= rgy albeit not market making which will be restricted under the non-compete=  with Netco.I would expect that we would have a strong business and transac= tional relationship with Netco.
=20 What will be NewCo's culture?
It will have the benefits of being a small pr= ivate company which will measure success by cashflow generation.
It will b= e a small company atmosphere where everyone knows each other.
It will be a=  group that celebrates success together and works hard towards shared objec= tives.
It will have an attractive employee compensation plan particularily=  for long term value creation.
We will build an organization of integrity = of which people can be proud.
It will center its objectives around our cust= omers and the satisfying un-met needs in the market.
NewCo will value cust= omer relationships.
It will be a partnership and employ an atmosphere of o= pen communication.
NewCo will be innovative, agile and nimble.
=20 What is next?
There will be a meeting in 30C2 at 4:00 PM on Monday to discu= ss issues, questions and comments.
There will also be a dinner set up for = 6:30PM on Tuesday at the Capital Grille to provide us an opportunity to spe= nd additional social time to discuss NewCo.
NewCo will be located on the 30= th floor.
The immediate tasks in hand can be broken into the following: a)=  opportunity and business definiton including fully vetted business plans f= or opportunities identified around specific assets or independent of these = assets; b) setting up infrastructure necessary to cure defaults and start p= erforming to key operating assets including managing out of the bankruptcy;=  c) modelling cashflows, operating costs, capital requirements and proforma= 's for NewCo; d) working through the NewCo structure and path through bankr= uptcy to solvency, rating and operation; e) scouring Enron for other valuab= le assets not yet identified for NewCo; f) detailed market research;  g) as= set acquisition target definition; h) financing and capitalization plan inc= luding raising external investment and i) additional hiring and recruitment= .
=20 On a final note, we will need to identify a new name for the company so let=  me know your ideas!

As I looked around the room at your=  breakfast meeting today it appeared many of the people in important manage= ment roles were probably at an age where they would like to stay at Enron, = work hard and hopefully be able to take care of immediate family needs (col= lege, etc.)
and then retire with a enough to enjoy their elder years.
Other= s were probably at an age where career changes are in their plans so it's t= he quick hits that will make a difference.
Maybe the mix was 50/50.
Clearly=  I'm in the former category.
Several people at the meeting commented about = the severe impact the current situation has had on their retirement plans a= nd how the time left to make this up is a concern.
In my relatively short t= ime here (3 1/4 years) I have made the following observation.
Enron has a g= reat Associate and Analyst program and these employees contribute immediate= ly to the company.
In addition Enron has a very young and mobile workforce = that provides great flexibility and energy to our efforts.
No doubt this ha= s led to the great success over the years.
However at the end of the day th= e business requires a level of maturity and experience that very effectivel= y complements this young and very talented workforce.
Helps pull things tog= ether and keep the sanity.
In many cases this translates to employees in th= eir mid to later years of their work life.
During the good times no problem=  as bonus $'s and other vehicles take care of things.
However we are possib= ly in a situation where those are limited or reduced to some extent for som= e extended period of time.
=20  Question: Do we need to do something positive, send a signal, to our middle=  aged and more senior employees that we understand the importance and value=  you add to the company and are willing to take a look at our pension/retir= ement plans.
When we come out of this current situation what will the compa= ny look like?
Will most of the younger crowd leave for the ""quick hits"" els= ewhere?
How do we maintain and protect our more senior employees.
How do we=  keep them here before they take another job that offers them additional se= curity?
Listening to Ken Lay at the employee meeting when asked a question = about pension I don't believe he really knew what type of retirement progra= m we have in place.
It really is, save all you can in your 401K and then we= 'll give you this cash balance vehicle to subsidize it.
I know the cash bal= ance option is a newer vehicle that many companies are moving to but Enron'= s is rather weak.
Many companies apply a larger percentage than Enron's 5%.=  Obviously this all has a cost, I know these plans were carefully considere= d over the years and changing anything at this point is not going to happen= .
In addtition this probably goes against our culture in many respects and = I'm not saying lets make this a job for life.
We still need to manage our w= orkforce as we have in the past and deal with employees that do not contrib= ute regardless of age.=20  Just wanted to share some honest thoughts and observations.
I get concerned=  when I look at the makeup of our workforce and think about commitment, loy= alty and ongoing leadership.
I promise this isn't about me although I certa= inly have my concerns as I know you do also.

54,"Once again this year, I am leading the BEAR (BE A Resource for CPS Kids) Holiday Fundraiser.
BEAR offers help and hope for abused and neglected children.
This program is more commonly known during the holidays as the ""BEARing Gifts"" Program, and it assists an average of 800 children a month.
Last year was the first year we called on Enron's Community Relations and our fellow employees to raise money for new bikes, in-line skates and scooters (each child also gets a helmet) for thousands of children under the care of Children's Protective Services.
BEARing Gifts provides holiday gifts to CPS kids who otherwise would have no holiday at all.
Please visit the Enron Lobby on November 5, 6, 7 or 8 between 11:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m., make a donation, and participate in our raffle to win free airline tickets and many other fabulous prizes.

57,"Sally,   here is a revised version of the savings for ENA, EGM, EIM, Back Office, Frameworks, and Corporate Systems.
There have been a number of changes as follows :-   Back Office The headcount numbers have changed because the original cuts took into account bugeted headcount counts rather than working from our currrent position.
Ramesh Rao spent some time today revising those figures to better represent what it will really take to address the three scenarios.
Also the changes reflect what it will take to support EA business only.
EES - at least, part of it - was supposed to be integrated into UNIFY early next year and therefore EES had a 20% allocation from the backoffice.
EGM/EIM Jeff made some slight alterations to make sure that current employee counts were accurate, and base cont/consultant headcount more on average budgeted for next year rather than actuals today.
They assumed in budgeting that contractors and consultants would be reduced next year as new dev in Thunderball, Freight and EIM started to be completed   The Summary page now shows savings rather than totals and all values are scaled to show millions....   regards

"
62,"As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.
We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.
It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.
?
ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.
The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.
Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.
Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.
Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?
Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.
As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.
Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.
We regret that we have had to make these changes.
We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

64,"Attached is a draft agenda for your review and comments.
As speakers were  confirmed, the placement of certain items on the agenda were dictated by the  speakers' schedules and then logical grouping of topics around those  speakers.
Sunday evening will not be heavy - simple welcome and intros,  drink and dinner - I know that many will be tired from traveling.
We have  arranged for a private showing of the movie Rogue Trader (complete with comfy  chairs and popcorn) which I thought could be fun for the group to see as a  means of setting the stage for our discussions on Monday and Tuesday.
This  can be optional, as I know that jet lag my get the best of some.
The morning on Monday will set the stage:  why we have gathered, endorsement  of our efforts (Causey).
Perhaps you, Brent and I could each give a short  ""state of the union of operations"" according to us - covering ENA, EGM and  EEL).
Then definition of the operating standards that we must uphold,  discussion, plans on reporting and buy in on these.
Monday lunch will allow everyone to share with their tablemates a project in  which they are involved that will have an impact on global consistency of  operational controls, or a project which through sharing or expanding could  have such an impact.
Each table can report back as we gather to start the  afternoon.
Having defined and discussed fundamental operating standards, we will move  Monday afternoon to review of the Doorstep concept: what, why, how and  lessons learned.
Then we will discuss next steps around this on-going  project.
Just before the afternoon break, we will roll out a new communications tool  for the operations controllers:  a website tailored for the group.
We will finish the afternoon by tying in operations performance and its  impact on assessing and measuring market risk and credit risk, with Ted  Murphy and Bill Bradford addressing the group.
Monday evening will include a tour of Enron Field and dinner at Ruggles  Center Field Terrace.
Bill Bradford will join us for dinner, and we are  waiting for an RSVP from Ted Murphy.
Tuesday morning will start with Jeff Skilling as our real keynote speaker.
He plans to spend an hour plus with the group.
He will make an informal  presentation and then will entertain questions.
The rest of the morning will  be spent in breakout teams, with assignments to come up with specific action  steps to strengthen operating controls, improve the accuracy of information  provided and move toward best practices in providing mid and back office  services within Enron.
Before lunch, Tom Gros and I will share a short story on CommodityLogic.
Philippe Bibi will join us for lunch to share his IT vision with the group.
After lunch, we will wrap up and summarize next steps, including a date to  reconvene much of this group perhaps early in 2001 to check progess against  our designated next steps (wholesale group in London perhaps).
Please call me or e:mail any comments or suggestions.
The only details still  in flux are Tom Gros' availability and confirmation of Philippe's  attendance.

68,"Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers.
However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.
The remainder are  senior specialists.
Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in  detail.
We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these  players away.
Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our  competitor, which will require that he have good people.
He will be moving  to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or  childless, their mobility factors could be high.
Enron would not want to  lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.
","Retention plan for four managers
"
69,"As you know, exceeding this limit would require contacting the Enron Board of  Directors.
Jeff Skilling is keenly interested in this measurement.
In  conversations with Ted Murphy today, Jeff has asked that he receive a daily  report from Ted on component V@R.  Ted called me about 3:00 pm today (Houston  time) to let me know about this requirement.
Obviously, we want to meet  Skilling's request with information that is as timely, accurate and  complete  as possible.
Therefore, we were concerned about feeds from London that over  the past several weeks have caused one London commodity or another to be  excluded from the first run of component V@R.  (Mike:  I assume that you are  very familiar with these feed problems from your representative that you send  to the daily 8:30 meeting.)
I pulled Steve Stock out of a pre-PRC meeting to meet with Ted, Shona, Ramesh  and me at 4:00 today.
Realizing that the time was very late in London, we  tried to reach you both at home numbers and by cell phone to include you in  the meeting.
Since we could not do so, we continued without you given that  Skilling will want to see this report daily starting tomorrow.
Here is the key fact to know:  It takes 3 hours to run the component V@R  calculations, once all inputs have been received and processed.
The  Component V@R calculations are kicked off at 6:30 am Houston time, producing  an approximate completion time of 9:30 am Houston time.
With this  timeframe, our goal would be to have the component V@R report to Jeff by  approximately 10:00 am Houston time.
Given current calculation times, in order to consistently calc component V@R  including all London feeds, London books (UK power, UK gas and Nordic power)  will have to be completed, calculated and officialized by 4:00 am Houston  time (10:00 am London time).
If this time frame is not met, then component  V@R reports for Jeff will be incomplete.
We had hoped to discuss this with  you today so that you could work with your operations staff, systems support  and traders to insure that you could consistently meet a 10:00 am London  requirement for officialized books.
The other immediate action to take is to ask Mike to work with David Hardy on  what we understand to be an almost-completed task of including UK spread  options in V@R calculations using the V@R engine.
Those V@R calculations  that are done through Excel calculations are not captured and included in the  component V@R calculations.
While there are other commodities that will  currently be excluded from component V@R reports, they are deemed to be less  material than the UK spread options.
Ramesh felt that it is only a matter of  days before this is completed.
Mike, we would like for you to stay on top of  this from an operations perspective to insure that this happens.
I should note that the firm 10:00 am deadline for officializing books in the  UK will only result in producing a report for Jeff by 10:00 am Houston time.
We don't know what Jeff's expectation will be regarding timing.
It is  probably safe to say that we should be actively looking at process and  systems changes that could result in the ability to deliver such a report  earlier in the morning.
Mike, I will call you during my morning commute on Thursday to see whether or  not you have any questions or if there are concerns about consistently  meeting the 10:00 am deadline in London.

Unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which  resulted in her being removed from the transplant list.
Randy has a four  year-old daughter.
Several of us will be attending the funeral today.
Over the past several  weeks within ENA, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a  fund raising effort that Randy's wife had headed for their civic  association.

75,"To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.
His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it  would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on  July 1.
Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth  transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen  would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance  review being based on his work for ENA.
Stephen is very talented and will no  doubt do a great job at EBS.
During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his  heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct  reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our  other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.
It was his  failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs  Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.
It is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that  category.

87,"This is a copy of the presentation that Bob Superty made to the Peoples  Energy Board this week.
Lousie Kitchen told me that he was very impressive  in the presentation (not a surprise to me, but it is nice when others  recognize the talent that is in the operations organization).
We may be able  to incorporate some of this into our presentation to originators for internal  purposes, and there may be parts of this that could be used in external  marketing tools.

89,"Does Vanessa know anything about this?
I know that we had a definite  interest several years ago in a system from Siebel.
We shelved it at the  time due to IT resource constraints and Philippe's concern over costs.
In  the meantime, EES bought a license and uses this system.
I know that Mary  was resurrecting this with someone on her team.
She had recently reviewed it  with Brenda Herod, I believe.
This is one of the items that we listed in  Dallas as a need if we were to get heavily into providing services for  others.

90,"Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.
I can  view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12  attendees.
There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.
I am  missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?
If I am not  missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees  (all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).
A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees  looks funny.
There were many more in attendance.
The cost of the meal makes  more sense with a complete list of attendees.
Thanks.

91,"All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great  and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules  next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.
I don't want  to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.
Karen's  letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting  these students names on our radar screen for next year.
I will find out who  the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes  and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.

92,"FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.
No  problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access  issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their  jobs.
She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston  who is bi-lingual (Gordon).
Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's  responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.
Just wanted to pass this  along.

94,"Kathryn Corbally (Senior Director currently in Investor Relations) is moving  to Connecticut soon to join her husband.
He has been working up there for  the last six or eight months - he was one of the group that defected from our  weather derivatives team about a year ago.
She hopes to continue to work for  Enron - has been talking with Investor Relations and some other groups that I  can't remember - and to do so either out of her home or in Enron's New York  office.
It struck me that depending upon needs at MG's New York office, that Kathryn  could be someone for you to consider.
She came originally from the London  office - you may or may not find anyone still there that could give you some  feedback on her.
In London, she ran mid and back office - that was in very  early days for EEL, so most of the job was probably accounting.
She came to  Houston and  has done a number of different things.
I think that she is well  organized and control minded.
Understands Enron's business.
Managing a  group of people is probably not her strongest attribute.
I am not sure that  people enjoy working under her.
That could be old news, however.
There are  a number of people here in Houston that could probably give you a read on her  based on very recent experience.
Do you know of her?
Just thought that I would mention her as a potential resource in New York.
Don't know what your short and longer term needs are there.
She would  definitely represent an Enron point of view.
They have two small daughters -  she might be interested in something part time even.
Could mean lower cost  that way.
This idea may not have any merit or you may not have a need around metals.
If you do want to consider this, I will be glad to help identify who you  could go to for some fact finding around her.
Let me know.

"
95,"Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.
I have the dubious  honor of being here late enough on Friday night to have seen the arrival of  the promotional memo via e:mail.
I will be in the London office next week  and I believe that we have some time scheduled together.
I look forward to  the chance to visit with you then.
--Sally
","Congratulations
"
96,"Please put this on your calendars - I would like for both of you to attend.
Should Jeff and Stacey be there, too?
This will be a meeting that we should  have regularly with Wes and team so that can jointly review any exposures and  make timely decisions on how to handle those.
I am sure that there is some  prep work that needs to be done for this meeting.
I would assume that we  should cover A/R, UA4, imbalances, weird or over/undervalued deals in risk  books, OA, etc.
Can you work with Greg and Georgeanne ahead of time on  content and have necessary back up to discuss highlights.
I would love for  us take charge and lead this meeting.

97,"From Enron Corp Business Controls   Operations in Enron's Crisis Management Center will cease at the close of business in Houston on September 12.
All inquiries or information pertaining to the events of the last two days should now be directed to Enron Corp Business Controls at 713.345.2804.
In the event immediate assistance is required after hours, the Business Controls telephone number will be answered by the 24x7 security desk which can have a representative from Business Controls return your call immediately.
With respect to employees stranded around the United States, we regret that these employees should make their way back to Houston or their home office as best they can via commercial airlines, train, or rental car.
Unfortunately, corporate and other private aircraft will not be flying until sometime after restrictions are lifted on commercial carriers.
Therefore, Enron corporate aircraft should not be counted on to provide assistance in this situation.

99,"Hello Everyone,   	This week again saw some upsets, both in college and pro games, however, the overall results were better this week than the past few weeks.
In the college games, it was split between the Oklahoma and Nebraska game as far as who got it right, the Auburn/Arkansas game and UCLA/Stanford game were both missed by most people.
Quite a few people also missed the Oregon/Washington St. game.
In the pros, the New Orleans/St.Louis game was missed by just about everyone, everyone missed the NY Giants/Washington game, the Minnesota/Tampa Bay game was missed by quite a few people, and the Arizona/Dallas game was also missed by about half the people.
Through all that, Rob Benson is currently in the lead with only 5 games missed.
Rob also picked Pittsburgh tonight.
Still alive for the money with 6 games missed are Joe Quenet and Jeff Miller, who both picked Tennessee tonight.
There were also 3 other people who have 6 wrong, however, they all chose Pittsburgh tonight.
Therefore, if Pittsburgh wins tonight, then Rob will win outright.
If Tennessee wins tonight, then it will come down to total points.
Rob chose 38 points, Joe has 48 points and Jeff has 34 points.
Therefore Jeff will win with a Tennessee victory and 35 or fewer total points, 36 he will tie with Rob.
Rob will also win if Tennessee wins and the total points are from 37-42 and he will also tie with Joe at 43 points.
Joe will win if Tennessee wins and there is 44 or more total points scored, 43 he will split with Rob.
We raised the entry fee to $3 per entry this week and will continue that for the rest of the season unless enough people want it back down to $2.
We had 34 entries this weekend, therefore the prize money is $102 !!
There is no Thursday night game this upcoming week, therefore this coming week's picks will be due on Friday.
Following is each person who played this week with the amount of games they missed.

100,"We are continuing work to ensure our new online trading system, UBSWenergy, is ready for launch on the week of Feb. 11, which is the week following the anticipated Enron/UBS Closing Date of Friday, Feb. 8.
To assist in this process, we are planning an online trading simulation for Thursday, February 7 from  0900 to 1100 (CST).
It is planned to include all  traders, originators, mid/back-office staff and IT teams who would normally be involved with electronic trading.
Purpose of the simulation - The simulation will test our ""live"" trading environment (restricted to internal access only) and will:  Test the integrity and functionality of the system and related processes (including credit, risk, legal, operations, etc.)
Provide an opportunity for traders to verify their products and product setup Demonstrate how the trading system and processes work to UBS staff visiting next week  Nature of the simulation - The simulation will include testing of all processes related to trading and mid/back-office functions:  Credit, Legal, Risk, Operations, and other groups: Profile tests for ""external"" customers (role-played by Originators) Profile tests for internal users (traders, back-office, etc.)
Data and Process checking as completed transactions flow through Mid/back-Office systems  Traders and Originators: Traders will be managing their individual books and associated products.
Although we may be restricted to certain financial products on launch day, both physical and financial will be available during the simulation.
Each trader will be asked to manage their individual position and profitability goals for the simulation.
Originators and others will be asked to play the roles of counterparties.
Credit limits, etc.
will be tested during the simulation.
Information Technology: Will assist in preparing data on the system for the simulation.
After the simulation is over, will work with the relevant groups to test the trade-data in various systems and risk books Will ensure all simulation data is removed from the system after the simulation is complete.
Next steps   Traders and Originators will be contacted prior to simulation day to ensure they have appropriate access to the system.
Originators will be assigned specific roles.
You should expect to receive an email and/or handout on or before Wednesday, Feb. 6.
UBSWenergy personnel will be meeting with back office personnel over the next several days to ensure everything is in place for the simulation.
Summary  This simulation is an important step towards re-launching our trading business.
We appreciate the participation of everyone involved as we prepare for the public launch of UBS Warburg Energy and the UBSWenergy trading platform.
If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or ideas regarding this simulation, please feel free to contact Bob Shults (30397) or myself (31861).

101,"In order to continually develop and make improvements to the functionality of EnronOnline we are rolling out several changes tonight, which will be in effect on Monday August 20, 2001.
Some of these changes will affect Stack Manager while others affect the Website.
A summary of these changes is listed below.
Stack Manager Changes  Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list the price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions; one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the "" Allowed Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.
Please note that this feature will be released in a disabled mode and will be turned on sometime next week after determining which business units want to roll this out.
Restricted Top of Stack limit orders - This feature will allow the price submitted only by internal traders via limit orders to be displayed on the website if their bid or offer is better than the trader's stack price.
Stack Manger will list price and the names of counterparties submitting such orders on the  floated stack window.
Orders will be queued by price and time stamp.
When a counterparty trades on a "" Top of Stack Entry"" it will create back to back transactions one between Enron and the counterparty submitting the order, and the other between Enron and the counterparty clicking on the website.
In order to turn on this functionality select the "" allowed as Restricted Top of Stack"" option, in the Orders section of the product properties page.
If regular limit order functionality is desired the ""Allowed""  option should be selected.
If a product has active orders against it you will not be able to select the ""Restricted Top of Stack"" feature.
Advanced Filtering Ability on All Products Tab -  Drop down filtering capability is now available for each field in the All Products tab in stack manager.
In order to filter click on the arrow next to the field title.
A drop down box with a list of attributes will appear.
Highlight the attribute by which you wish to filter.
To turn off the filter click on the arrow and select the "" All"" option from the drop down box.
Website Changes  New Submission Screen for Restricted Top of Stack Limit Orders -  The submission screen for  products that allow  Top of Stack or Restricted Top of Stack limit orders is as follows.
The submit button on the left makes a submission for a normal transaction, while the button on the right will submit as a limit order.
In case of the Restricted Top of Stack limit orders only internal traders will see the new submission box.
Price of Limit Orders   Modify Limit Orders  Customers now have the ability to modify the price of any active order.
In order to do so highlight the order to be modified and use the plus or minus sign next to the price field on  at the top of the ""Today's Orders"" section.
The price will move up or down in the same increments as the tick size for that product.
Once the price is at the desired level click the ""Set"" button and the price will be modified.
Another way to modify the price on a limit order is to click on the price field on a particular limit order.
You will see a box with plus, minus and set buttons that allow you to modify that order.
Expiration time for Limit Orders Customers can now place limit orders with expiration times of up to 30 days.
Currently they may place orders for only up to 12 hours.
Float the Today's Orders Section You can now float the "" Limit Order "" section.
In order to do so, right click in the ""Today's Orders "" section and select the float window option.
In order to make the window "" Stay On Top "" right click on the floated window and select the stay on top option.
Mid Market Client - Mid market originators will now have the ability to transact on behalf of their customers, while including their desired margin on the trade, on EnronOnline products.
In order to do so Click on the bid or offer price, a customised submission window will appear.
Select the counterparty for whom you wish to transact from a drop down list , enter the desired customer price and margin and click submit.
For example if a customer wants to buy Nymex Sep 01 at 3.36 and you wish to have a 1 cent margin, please enter 3.36 as the desired price and 0.01 as the margin.
The system will trade the order when the EnronOnline offer for Nymex Sep 01 is at 3.35, book the trade at 3.36 and record the 0.01 origination amount.
In order to be set up to use this functionality.
Please call the EnronOnline Product Control Group.
Changes to Website Passwords - As an added security measure, which has been requested by many customers, some new password rules have been instituted.
First, the password cannot be equal to the login ID.
Second, each user will be prompted to change his password every 90 days.
These rules apply to all website passwords for both internal and external users.
Please note  Stack Manager changes will be available all traders as of Monday August 20, 2001.
The changes to the website will be rolled out to a few internal users on Monday with the rest of the internal users being upgraded Monday night, and external users by the end of the week.
Over the next couple of weeks all users will be prompted to change their website passwords.
If you have any questions regarding these changes please contact me at 713-853-1787.

103,"Several changes have been made to Stack Manager and the website.
These changes are outlined below and will be visible by all as of Monday September 3, 2001.
Stack Manager Changes  Activate/Inactivate Stack - This functionality allows the trader to pull a product's prices from the website without suspending the product.
If the Top of Stack limit order functionality is activated for a particular product this should be used to pull the stack prices from the website without pulling the entire product; therefore, if there are top of stack limit orders against the product they will remain visible and transactable on the website.
If a product's stack is inactivated the font for that product will be grayed out in stack manager.
If the stack is active it will appear in black font.
To use this feature, select the product, right click and choose ""Inactivate Stack"".
When you are ready to reactivate your prices, select the same product, right click again and choose ""Activate Stack"".
There are also icons on the tool bar at the top of your screen which will Activate/Inactivate the stack of the highlighted product.
See screen shot below for the icons.
Changes to Product Properties - Currently when modifications are made to certain properties within the product properties screen, the product will be suspended and pulled from the website.
Now instead of being suspended, the product's stack will become inactive.
Once the changes have been made and saved to the properties of a product simply click the Activate Stack icon as discussed above.
Website Change  Restrictions on Top of Stack orders - If Top of Stack limit orders are allowed on a product, but the trader is not showing both a bid and offer, limit orders will not be able to be placed on that product.
If you have any questions please call me at 31787.

News from the Global Flash  EES Europe Celebrates Pirelli Deal EES Europe is celebrating another deal with an attractive brand name after clinching a three-year contract with Pirelli Cables and Systems, the world's leading energy cable manufacturer.
The deal gives EES the right to match bids to supply gas and electricity to 18 manufacturing sites in Italy and the UK.
EES will also assess opportunities for energy management programmes designed to increase energy efficiency at Pirelli's facilities.
Bob Manasse, Vice President Origination of EES Europe, said: ""Congratulations to all those involved for securing EES another great deal which will strengthen our position in Europe and give us a valuable point of entry into the Pirelli tire organization and the recently acquired Telecom Italia.""
German Gas Deal - First Municipality Transaction Signed in BEB Territory  Congratulations are due to the Frankfurt and London-based gas teams who, in the face of tough competition from the Northern German incumbent supplier, BEB Erdgas and Erdoel (a jointly held Shell and Exxon subsidiary), succeeded in securing two gas supply agreements with the cities of Peine and Uelzen on 24th August.
Securing transmission will be challenging due to the fact that BEB has the most onerous grid access terms in Germany.
However, the gas team is hopeful these transactions will bring about a turning point in gaining access to customers within BEB's territory, which until Enron closed on these deals was considered to be the ""heart land"" of Germany.
Enron Names New UK Coal-Hauling Freight Locomotive On Saturday, 1st September, a ten-strong delegation from Enron's coal team traveled up to British Energy's Eggborough coal-fired power station to take part in the naming ceremony for a newly-acquired Class 66 freight locomotive, recently put into service by Enron business partner and rail freight specialist, Freightliner Heavy Haul.
Enron and Freightliner Heavy Haul signed a contract for UK coal transport in June 2000, effectively breaking the local monopoly in the rail transport of coal held by an incumbent rail freight company.
True to form, the introduction of competition has reduced rates and dramatically improved service levels.
Stuart Staley, Enron's international coal group vice-president, praised the dedication of the Freightliner train drivers and staff who have contributed to the success of the service for Enron.
While Eddie Fitzsimons, managing director of Freightliner Heavy Haul Ltd noted:  'We only started running coal trains in December 2000 and we have now run more than 17,000 individual wagon journeys containing more than one million tonnes of coal, almost all of that for Enron.'
The coal team selected the name Don Raider from numerous entries received from an earlier Globalflash competition:  ""The new locomotive was named Don Raider, after the river Don, a major river in South Yorkshire where a number of our customers are located,"" explains Tom Kearney, a director in Enron's international coal group who executed the original deal with Freightliner.
""Other ""Raider Class"" Freightliner Heavy Haul locomotives will be named at a later date, each bearing the name of a river which flows near to coal-fired power stations and major coal-importing ports.""

112,"Due to the additional activity within ETS and the holidays, we will not hold a GISB Update meeting during the remainder of this year.
Hopefully we'll get back on a schedule after the first of the year.
Below is my update on a few GISB matters.
We'll go into more detail at our next meeting.
ENERGY INDUSTRY STANDARDS BOARD (EISB) The GISB Board of Directors has approved revisions to GISB's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to incorporate language necessary to transition to the new organization, which will address standards for wholesale and retail gas and electric transactions.
The new organization, which goes into effect January 1, 2002, will be named the North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB).
The wholesale gas quadrant, which is now GISB, should continue with business as usual.
In January, I'll give a more detailed update on the workings of NAESB.
GISB REPRESENTATON Stan Horton's term on the GISB Board of Directors expires December 31, 2001.
Shelley Corman will take his place on the Board.
Her term expires December 31, 2003.
My term as a representative on GISB's Executive Committee expires December 31, 2003.
ORDER 637 TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING The development of the new transactional reporting datasets for use on EBBs is almost complete.
The EBB implementation should be included in the next publication, which is scheduled for July 31, 2002.
This is probably a firm date.
The EDI implementation is now a lower priority, but will still be developed.
GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS AND ERRATA Two separate errata have been developed for the version 1.5 standards.
The errors in the standards books are extensive.
The errata are posted alongside the books on the GISB homepage and have been distributed internally to all who received standards books.
I am working to have GISB correct the standards books.
Some people want to hold off and incorporate the corrections into the next version.
Our implementation will be much smoother if we don't have to continually refer to the errata along with the standards books.
I'll let you know what is decided.
Thanks,

117,"Lynn/Karen:   The November 1 termination of the reverse auction point on Northern will increase the probability of priority mismatches at Aberdeen and Welcome between our two systems.
We have already received questions asking how we will confirm these points after the 1st.
And our response has been that we would expect the restricting party to dictate who can and cannot flow at these locations.
One party that has been surprisingly quiet so far has been Mirant.
Mirant should be very interested in how we will allocate capacity at these two points on November 1, simply because their contracts have the greatest risk of not being scheduled.
They are the only firm shipper on Northern Border that have Aberdeen and Welcome as contracted path end points.
And as you know, they supplied the reverse auction point.
But from what we have heard on the street, they are not actively matching up their supply with those markets who were allocated reverse auction capacity on your system.
That is why I feel the odds are high for a capacity mismatch.
Mirant does have a couple of options with their Welcome contract on Border; they can drop some of their Welcome gas off at a secondary upstream point, such as Marshall.
But their Aberdeen contract needs to flow at either Aberdeen or Warner on our system.
And if their capacity is stranded at Aberdeen on the 1st, I am confident that they will be giving both of us a call.
Between Aberdeen and Warner (our alternate delivery point to NWPS), we have the ability to deliver into this area an aggregate of over 70 MMcf/d.
If we do see firm and interruptible gas nominated into these points in excess of this amount, I feel Northern Border must zero out the interruptibles on our side - that was the issue that created so much heart burn for Pan Alberta years ago when we were forced to allocate Ventura.
But that is as far as we are planning to go.
We view the flow restriction to be on your side.
And we are suggesting that your priorities be used to allocate Aberdeen on the 1st.
If we do a firm allocation based on Border's priorities before we confirm, we would have a definite mismatch, and potentially nothing would be scheduled at the point.
Now that would not be all bad, given that we could use such an opportunity to deliver off the large OBA imbalance gas due NNG at the point.
But I don't think we want to fire up a battle with the shippers on both sides of the fence; we'll deal with Mirant on our end.
As for the Aberdeen OBA imbalance issue, I am still trying to come up with a long term solution to deal with that situation.
Any ideas as to how we can effectively eliminate the imbalance would be greatly appreciated, especially given the fact that the Energy Affiliate NOPR suggests that the flexibility we may have today could be restricted in the future.

135,"Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back.
Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves.
Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book.
Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.
Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred.
Legal is deciding difference between ""executable"" contracts (able to negate deal) and ""forward"" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale.
South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.
In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking.

147,"Gentlemen:  	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics (and any others which occur to you):  1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified therein) established;  2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;  3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the wholesale gas and electricity business.
It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of recent investments and perhaps on the larger ""asset"" investments such as Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.
Even as we move away from these investments, there may be some additional lessons to be learned.
Does our post-audit process and procedure continue?
We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

152,"Rick,  I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.
I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.
I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
1.
VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.
This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period.
After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.
2.
NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.
Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.
Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
If you agree with these changes please let me know.
If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.

162,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.
The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

172,"The invoices for December 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Friday, September 28, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.
Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing process;  (2)  adjust regulation penalty charges to zero for suppliers; and (3)  adjust  the  NYISO  clearing account balance to zero for December 1999 settlements.
With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix.
As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is   done  outside  of  the  billing  process.
The  total  adjustment  of $581,563.37  was  allocated  across 13,147,961 MWh.
Customers may validate their  respective  adjustments  by  computing  their  ratio  shares  of the $581,563.37  using  5,059,790  MWh  as  the denominator in their respective ratios of their December 1999 load.
Customers will observe a difference in the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus  adjustment  #3.
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.
Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.
This  billing treatment for the December  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market totaling  $5,219,402.09  allocated  across 13,191,237 MWh.
Customers where allocated their portion of adjustment #3 above, based upon their respective ratio shares of the 13,191,237 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month.
December  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address  the  delay  in  invoicing.
Payments due to the NYISO for December 1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account  on  Monday, October 15, 2001.
Payments due to market participants will  be  made on Friday, October 19, 2001.

193,"Roger, presented below are the comments which Transwetern has on the permits  which were issued to the Klagetoh and Luepp compressor station.
The most  critical and sensitive issue for us is item 2 below.
The permits really  restrict us and cause us some major operational concerns if we are held to 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO throughout the entire operating range of the turbines.
We would really appreciate your help and assistance in this issue.
Let me  know what additional information you may need.
1.The responsible official name change to Danny Pribble, VP Southwest Operations.
2.The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to 25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour  average, except during periods of startup and shutdown.
At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these rates are achievable under all operating conditions.
However, GE data indicates that NOx and CO may be as  high as 40 ppmv during low-load conditions of 60% and lower.
The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of the time with reduced load operations (64% load)occurring no more than 20% of the time.
TWP also included a 15% safety factor to cover periods of reduced operating loads and fluctuating ambient temperatures.
The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in the application in units of lb/hr and ton/yr.
These potential to emit values were accepted by the EPA for the netting analysis, and were taken into account by the EPA (See EPA Statement of Basis document).
Because the permit conditions hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60% and low ambient temperatures, the emissions of NOx and CO could go as high as 40 ppmvd.
Transwestern is requesting that a provision be made in the permit conditions that allows emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40 ppmvd during the 20 % of the time that the turbines operating conditions is less than or equal to 60% load.
3.
The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.
4.
Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not normally used to monitor and       measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has received approval from the EPA for other custom fuel monitoring schedules to use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.
","Transwestern's comments to rough drafts of permit for Klagetoh and  Leupp

194,"Approval was received from the Texas Railroad Commission to discontinue  groundwater monitoring at the Pucket Plant.
As you may remember,  Transwestern constructed a permitted landfill to dispose of the entire  facility near Ft. Stockton.
Groundwater montioring activities have been  ongoing since aprox.
1988.
A permit condition states that if three years of  groundwater sampling data confirms that the groundwater protection standard  has not been exceeded, the groundwater monitoring activities can be  terminated.
A letter from Leslie Savage granting this approval was received  on July 14, 1999.
Ken Gray, all other conditions of the permit are still in effect (noxious  weed and mesquite control, monthly site inspections recordkeeping etc.....).
Continue to keep the records accurate and up to date.
I anticipate that we  will be required to monitor  and conduct housekeeping activities at the site  indefinately.
","Groundwater Monitoring to be Discontinued at the Puckett Plant
"
195,"George, Ive read through your stuff on the Gomez remediation and need some  help.
Why are we collecting so much groundwater.
Im concerned that charges  for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the  costs are reasonable.
Are we trying to dewater or what?
Other than that, I  dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should  get busy on the well installations.
Do you think this will do it with  respect to no more wells needed.
Id like to get to that position as quickly  as possible.

According to the agency, this  replacement activity will not require an amendment to the permit, which will  be a plus for the company.
My compliments to all involved for the retesting and efforts it took to make  this happen.
I will forward the response from the TNRCC as it is received.

207,"Michelle,  Kristin Walsh, a manager in Competitive Analysis, is returning from maternity leave on October 15th.
During Kristin's absence, the following changes have occurred in the group, and I just wanted to run them by you before we communicate them to her: 1)  Kristin will only have two direct reports instead of three.
2) Previously, Kristin's team as a whole was responsible for providing ENA (i.e.
John and Louise, as well as traders) with competitive intelligence.
Instead of Kristen just overseeing the ENA process as a whole, Kristin and her two team members will have more specific duties, although Kristin will still be the primary point of contact for ENA.
Specifically, Kristin will gather and provide intelligence info for the Gas Team, and Kelly Holman will gather and provide info for East Power, and  Greg Whitman will do the same for West Power.
Robert Johnston, Kristin's supervisor,  and Scott Tholan, BUL, just felt like the level of service that Kristin's team was providing was not adequate because efforts were duplicated and Kristin could not provide enough ""face time"" with the head traders to gather and relay info, as well as directing her team.
Also,after Kristin's departure, it was learned that Kristen signed a contract for which she had no authority.
Although Scott does not think that this has happened before, this particular contract blew up in their face.
Upon Kristin's return, Scottt, Robert, and I would like to communicate these changes to her (not in writing, just verbally), and just reitterate the fact that only Scott has the authority to sign contracts.
Additionally, we would like to tell Kristin that she needs to take a management training class so that she can learn to delegate and oversee responsibilities of the group, rather than micromanaging them.
Please let me know if this is going to create any additional problems, or if I need to take a different approach.

In this scenario, there are 4 marketing employees which would come to Enron as a part of the deal.

Secondly, Enron's purchase of the marketing rights will be for an 18mo to 3 year trial period.
At the end of the trial period, if Enron returns the marketing rights to Vulcan (or current owner), they want the right to re-call these employees.

215,"The proposed discipline below is designed to provide guidelines for HR generalists in addressing violations of the ""Internet Security Policy for the use of Electronic Media and Services"" to ensure consistency in the application of disciplinary measures.
In general, the discipline should follow the corrective action policy that has been established for addressing unacceptable conduct (see policy #11, corrective discipline).
The recommendations below are designed to address situations where employees transmit externally electronic communication that is ""discriminatory, harassing, threatening, derogatory, obscene, defamatory, a ""chain letter"" or junk mail, untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest or for personal profit"" (as outlined in Enron's Code of Ethics).
First Offense:  Automated electronic warning that the system has detected an inappropriate electronic mail being sent from the employee's mail box and that another violation will result in the HR Representative and Supervisor being notified and possible disciplinary action.
Also warning message refers employee to Internet Security Policy.
Second Offense:  Second automated electronic warning to employee with copy to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to verbally warn employee to ensure understanding of Company policy.
Third Offense:  Third automated electronic warning to employee with a copy to Supervisor and HR.
HR Rep and Supervisor to give Written warning to employee to be placed in PH file.
Written warning to state that further violation may result in termination.
Fourth Offense:  System notice of shut down for continuing violation.
Copy of notice sent to HR Rep and Supervisor.
HR Rep and Supervisor to consult with Legal depart prior to employee termination for misconduct.
Using these guidelines, it is suggested that the  HR Rep and Management consider the specifics of the offense and determine the appropriate corrective action.
Other Issues/Considerations: Should we carve out transmissions that are ""untrue, fraudulent, illegal, against Company policy, contrary to the Company's interest and for personal profit"" and have a more severe discipline for those situations?
Should same discipline be used when employees access inappropriate or pornographic sites.
Should we attempt to define all terms?
Is it appropriate to use a ""one size fit's all"" approach.
Should the discipline for transmitting motivational messages be the same as discipline for a threatening, obscene, derogatory, etc.
message?
How should we address inappropriate electronic messages transmitted internally?

It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and  	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution.
?
It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such as Full Requirement  and load following contract.
?
It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.

232,"I thought you would be interested in the weather forecast for the Wedding.
The data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88  and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation  from normal and percent of precipitation.
So far things are looking good.
We are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting Texas on Monday) and looks  like things should be beautiful for next weekend.
I wouldn't be that worried  about the rain either - the reason the POP is so high right now is tropical  moisture in the Gulf of Mexico and that will blow through this weekend.
After that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get  tropical  moisture.

245,"Attached for your review and comment is a first draft of the WPTF motion to intervene and protest the WestConnect filing.
The major points made in it are as follows:  ?
The Commission should convene a technical conference to deals with areas in the WestConnect filing that require further clarification, such as congestion management.
Moreover, the analysis of congestion management issues must focus on the equitable allocation of transmission rights;  ?
The Commission should require WestConnect to establish an independent board, with an accompanying stakeholder process that complies with commission precedent;  ?
All load should be required to take service under the WestConnect tariff;   ?
Interconnection issues should be deferred until completion of the Commission's generic proceeding on this topic; and  ?
Since a for-profit Transco has an inherent incentive to maximize transmission revenue, there are certain RTO functions that an entity such as WestConnect should not perform.
I am indebted to Karen Shea of Dynegy and Glenn Martin of Mirant for their very helpful assistance.
Our draft also draws upon concepts contained in the EPSA filing that Gary Ackerman provided.
The filing is due at FERC on Thursday the 15th.
I therefore need any comments from you no later than early that morning.

246,"Dear Mr. Dasovich:  I am looking for a position in the Bay area as my wife will begin teaching at the Goldman School of Public Policy in January.
Cecille Cabacungan from GSPP suggested that I contact you.
Currently, I am with Mercer Management Consulting, a strategy consulting firm.
While I enjoy my work with Mercer, the timing of transfers to our San Francisco office is uncertain.
Mercer, however, has two programs through which I could move to the Bay area.
The first is an externship program through which I could consult to a company for 6 - 12 months, or longer.
As my attached resume reflects, I have several years of experience developing business plans and assessing market conditions.
The second is a fellowship program through which I could consult to a non-profit organization for up to 12 months at a small fraction of Mercer's standard fees.
I am particularly interested in organizations that work on economic development issues, but would be happy to help a range of organizations develop and implement their long-term strategic goals.
Specific types of work I could perform include:  *	Assessing market size and growth opportunities, e.g., utility/profitability of new services or products *	Managing co-operative efforts with other institutions, e.g., pooling resources to increase leverage and efficiency of operations *	Benchmarking and redistributing resources to focus on highest impact areas  I would like to learn whether you think Enron could benefit from my services or know of a corporation or non-profit that could.
I am arranging interviews for the first week of December, and would greatly appreciate talking to you before then to hear of any suggestions you may have.
I look forward to hearing from you, and thank you in advance for your assistance.

247,"Based on information received at 4 pm this afternoon from Comm.
Brown, the CPUC is reportedly set to suspend direct access tomorrow with an effective date of Sept. 20 for the suspension.
There has been a huge drop in state tax revenues this week as a result of economic inactivity due to the terrotist attacks, and this appears to have reinvigorated the need to issue bonds--if they can be sold.
In any event, it appears Brown is a solid vote

266,"Energy Committee Members:  We have been offered an opportunity to benefit from a unique federal funding program.
Sure Power has been funded to implement distributed generation (DG) into a high-availability, energy-intensive application in the data communications industry (i.e.
telecom hotel, financial processing center, internet data center, etc.).
As you know, Sure Power is the world's leading supplier of DG-based systems providing six 9's availability (certified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology).
Sure Power's patented technology eliminates interconnection issues with the utility, which has been one of the technical inhibitors to widespread adoption of DG.
Sure Power has already aligned themselves with EPRI to assist them with measurement and analysis, but are looking for a partner who has a potential project on the horizon that could benefit from Sure Power's technology and federal funding assistance (as much as $3M).
Please note, the project does not have to be past the internal approval stage to benefit.
Even a potential project that is still being analyzed for viability could receive funding for an initial feasibility study.
Understanding that the high-tech industry is going through trying times, and that many projects have been put on hold; Sure Power has a three-year window in which to apply the funds, so even a project that may not start for eighteen months would work.
The deadline in which to finalize their project package is September 12, so Sure Power would need to have a response from a potential partner no later than COB Tuesday September 4.
Feel free to contact Sure Power directly with any questions.

Just wanted to pass along some info.
I'm sure you've seen Senator  Feinstein's comments to FERC.
And I think you're aware that she held a  meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on  the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.
She stated  at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to  place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.
Economists in the room  expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly  focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.
Not sure where it  will go, but wanted to pass it along.

276,"USA: INTERVIEW-EnronOnline sees volume growth, CEO says.
By Gelu Sulugiuc  07/17/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - As most players in a shrinking pool of online  energy trading platforms struggle to stay alive, leader EnronOnline has a  simple philosophy: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
The Internet arm of the energy marketing and trading giant Enron Corp. ,  EnronOnline predicts it will increase its volume and says it can coexist with  the IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), the chief executive of Enron Networks  told Reuters on Tuesday.
The innovative company is always evaluating its business environment, ready  to remold itself according to market demands, but it is not pursuing mergers  or aquisitions for now, according to Greg Piper.
""I would never say never, but we're not proactively looking at aquiring an  ownership position in any other exchange platform,"" Piper said.
With an average of $3.5 billion in trades every day, EnronOnline enjoys the  highest volume of all energy electronic platforms.
Most energy trading  platforms launched last year have failed to generate profits.
Its closest rival is ICE, which routinely exceeds $1 billion a day.
But while  ICE is a many-to-many exchange that matches bids and offers, on EnronOnline  one can only trade with Enron.
""It's a tool that supercharges our market-making business,"" Piper said.
Enron is the No.
1 natural gas and electricity marketer in the United States.
About 60 percent of its transactions are captured through the electronic  platform.
""As long as we show good prices to our customers, our volumes will continue  to grow,"" Piper said.
The company is looking to grow online volume in products such as metals,  steel, weather, petrochemicals and plastics.
""We're trying to remain the leader in energy and help our other markets get  more traction,"" Piper said.
""There is a huge amount of growth that we haven't  even tapped into yet.""
Piper said he is not worried about ICE's recent success.
The Atlanta-based  exchange recently took over London's International Petroleum Exchange and  plans to transfer its open-outcry business online, significantly boosting its  trade volumes.
""Maybe six to 12 months from now, the story might be a lot different,"" Piper  said.
""But right now, there is room for the both of us.""
He added that Enron traders do not shy away from trading on ICE.
Many of the  energy giants that founded ICE and provide most of its liquidity are also  Enron's biggest clients.
""Enron will seek out a good deal on ICE when there is one,"" Piper said.
INNOVATION KEY TO SUCCESS  Recognized as one of the most innovative companies in the United States,  Enron is constantly evaluating its position in the market and thinking of  ways to become more successful.
""The right thing to do in November 1999 was to launch EnronOnline,"" Piper  said.
""But we look at it every day and if it made sense to do something  different, you can bet that Enron would do it and we wouldn't be emotional  about it.""
One of the company's advantages is the fact that its software is a flexible  application that allows EnronOnline to easily go in an out of different  markets and regions.
It constantly adds new products to its trading arsenal.
But Piper said that EnronOnline has no plans to turn itself in a many-to-many  exchange.
""We want to focus in providing our markets to others,"" he said.
""In the near  term, we're not changing that.""
The company is considering licensing the application itself, but would not  elaborate on who wants it and how much Enron would ask for it.
EnronOnline has been so successful that even its competitors take their hats  off.
""I've been hearing for two years now that a one-to-many exchange wouldn't  work, but Enron just keeps proving people wrong,"" said Frank Getman, chief  executive of online energy exchange HoustonStreet.
""If you're willing to make tight two-way markets and be the best price in the  market, then people will continue to use your site.""
Enron's stock rose 41 cents to $49.53 a share on Tuesday in trading on the  New York Stock Exchange.

Peevey asked for the meeting to urge Enron to respond to DWR=01,s RFP issue= d on=20 Friday.
Peevey/Freeman want to announce a package of deals on Tuesday.
Th= ey=20 implied that they=01,ve already got some deals done and expect to have 8+ d= eals=20 to announce on Tuesday, though they gave no details other than to say that= =20 they=01,ve got a deal with Calpine (as reported in the press).

They are concern= ed=20 that the media will want them to make public the details of each individual= =20 deal, which for obvious reasons they don=01,t want to do.
Peevey and Freeman also said that they don=01,t want to sign too many long-= term=20 contracts though they recognize that there=01,s a trade-off between term an= d=20 price.
Ken Lay told them that Enron would respond.
ENA is preparing a response.

I=01,ve summarized the points that Ken Lay made and the responses from Peev= ey=20 and Freeman:  It would be difficult to enter into contracts without some assurance that D= WR=20 is creditworthy.
Response from Peevey/Freeman: AB1X provides DWR the funds necessary=01*beginning on Friday, Feb 1st=01*to= =20 purchase the power necessary to fill the utilities=01, short position.
Ken=  Lay=20 pressed them on this point and Peevey insisted that AB1X provides the funds= =20 needed to pay suppliers.
The RFP should give suppliers maximum flexibility in coming up with proposa= ls.
Response from Peevey/Freeman: Be as creative as possible.
All offers will be considered (despite the=20 language contained in the RFP).
The only customers who have been protected from California=01,s failed=20 restructuring law are customers who chose another provider under Direct=20 Access.
In addition, one of the quickest ways to help solve California=01,= s=20 shortage is to work with customers to reduce demand and develop on-site=20 generation.
Taking away Direct Access and access to customers generally=01= *as=20 AB1X does=01*is therefore a dumb idea and must be reversed.
Response from Peevey: He agreed but said that it was impossible to remove it from the bill.

In=20 response to Ken Lay=01,s points that California needed to make sure that ut= ility=20 interconnection and stand-by rates didn=01,t continue to impede on-site=20 generation, Peevey and Freeman said that the Governor understood the proble= m=20 and was prepared to fix it.

Response from Peevey/Freeman: The Governor is scheduled to offer a plan this week that is targeted at=20 expediting siting and development.
DWR should accept demand reduction bids at the same time that it accepts=20 supply-side bids.
Response from Peevey/Freeman: They agreed but said that there is extreme political pressure to announce t= he=20 signing of some supply deals on Tuesday in order to prove to legislators th= at=20 DWR will be able to keep the lights on, and at a =01&reasonable=018 price.

Governor To Address State  BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN   DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.
BODY:  ??
?While Gov.
Gray Davis prepared to speak to the state Thursday night about California's energy crisis, economic forecasters predicted the power crunch would lead to higher taxes and scrapped public projects.
?
?Davis said Wednesday he hadn't written his five-minute address, but that he planned to discuss ''the progress that we've made and what we have to get through.''
?
?Among other things, he was expected to talk about the more than 40 percent rate increases approved last week by the Public Utilities Commission for customers of the state's two largest utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  and Southern California Edison Co.
He has asked California television stations to carry his remarks live.
?
?California has been hit with rolling blackouts and tight power supplies blamed in part on soaring wholesale electricity costs.
?
?On Wednesday, the state got more bad economic news: The UCLA Anderson Business Forecast said Californians would face higher taxes and a tighter  state budget because of the billions of state dollars being spent on emergency  power.
The blackouts and the state's scrutiny of private power suppliers also  threaten to scare away new businesses, the report said.
?
?Facing continued refusal from federal energy regulators to cap high energy prices, Davis said Wednesday he would be willing to support a windfall-profits tax on electric generators that have made a fortune selling power to  California this year.
?
?A bill to that effect was introduced Wednesday in the state Assembly.
It would tax gross receipts that ''significantly exceed'' the cost of producing power and tax profits of power marketers who have bought power and later sold  it at much higher rates.
??
''We continue to allow some electricity generators and middlemen to reap enormous profits on their sales of electricity into the state.
This  profiteering must stop,'' Democratic Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett said.
?
?Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said he doubted a tax on a selected industry would be legal.
He added that such a tax would discourage generators from building new power plants in California.
??
''The governor has made very clear that he is trying to do whatever he can  to increase the amount of generation in California and reduce the price.
Windfall-profits taxes do neither of these,'' Williams said.
?
?Davis said he generally opposes treating profitable companies in that  manner, ''but these profits are outrageous and are at our expense.
The only things companies understand is leverage.''
?
?For the first time, Davis also said the state should let companies buy their power from generators instead of going through the utilities.
?
?The Utility Reform Network and the head of the PUC oppose the idea.
They argue residential customers and small businesses unable to contract with generators would get stuck with the bill for the billions of dollars the state has and will spend buying electricity for the customers of the cash-strapped utilities.
HEADLINE: 'Chaos' in state electricity planning  BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens  BODY:  ?
?LOS ANGELES _ Two hundred of the finest economic minds in California  gathered Wednesday at UCLA's Anderson School of Management to discuss the state's  energy crisis but, as state Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch  spoke, the power to her microphone cut out intermittently and unexpectedly.
??
""I don't have any control over this,"" the beleaguered technician operating the sound system called out after repeated outages.
??
""I feel your pain,"" Lynch replied with a smile.
?
?No one in the audience doubted that.
After two rounds of rolling blackouts that state officials were powerless to prevent, Lynch last week led the commission to hike retail power rates 42 percent, sparking protests from consumer groups.
?
?But at UCLA Lynch had power and natural gas producers in her sights.
She promised to lead ""a war against the sellers who are taking so much value out  of the California economy and not adding a whit of value.""
?
?Lynch said she favored reinstatement of wholesale price caps that were ended by the Federal Energy Rate Commission in December but wasn't counting on that.
?
?Even without those caps, she said she was optimistic that the state had enough tools to restrain price hikes by wholesalers and avoid another rate  hike.
?
?Those tools include conservation, purchases of long-term power contracts by the Department of Water Resources, utility cost cutting and making sure the small power producers known as qualifying facilities are online, she said.
?
?Lynch dismissed the state's 1996 deregulation plan as a ""failed experiment"" and said she did not accept a questioner's premise that ""true deregulation is our goal.""
The problem was that ""the state stepped back too much"" from management of the power system and that there had been ""too much ideology and theory and not enough practical solutions,"" she added.
?
?A panel of experts offered some grim predictions.
""We are expecting severe difficulties for this summer and next summer,"" said Barry Sedlik, a Southern California Edison manager.
?
?Mark Bernstein, an analyst with the Rand Corp. in Santa Monica, said the electricity problems are spreading.
""This may go on for a while and it's not just California,"" he said.
""In the near term we've got chaos,"" he added.
?
?But he offered one macabre ray of hope.
He said that federal policymakers  may feel more urgency to step in if, as now appears possible, rolling  blackouts occur in 2002 in Florida where, he didn't need to add, President  Bush's brother is governor.
?
?Problems with the transmission system there, as well as generation shortage, could hurt Florida but the state has enough time to avoid a crisis, he said in an interview.

"
305,"Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action  FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River  Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the  natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were  happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved.
""The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is  something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,"" but the  ""precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,"" warned  Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision.
Although  she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC  ""should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.""
Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action  expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the  ""extraordinary regulatory treatment"" that the Commission gave it.
Critics  claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler  Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she  noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas.
""...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in  the California marketplace.
This makes it difficult to understand just how  our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing  electric generation in California this summer,"" Breathitt said.
If anything,  she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even  worse than it is.
There should have been a ""fuller airing of this issue"" at FERC before the  project was certificated, she noted.
""It would be counterproductive for this  Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without  ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more

Nancy McFadden, former deputy chief of staff to Gore, will earn $118,000 a  year as a senior adviser to the governor, said Steve Maviglio, Davis'  spokesman.
McFadden will concentrate on the governor's relations with federal  regulators and with generators.
Davis also has recruited Kellan Fluckiger, chief operations officer for the  Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid.
Fluckiger is ""on loan"" from the ISO, and will work with energy suppliers,  Maviglio said.

Wright was very critical of how the Governor is handling the issue and wants  to craft a solution with the industry and then invite the Governor to get on  board.
Wright threw a whole laundry list of options on the table for folks to  consider (Dave's typing up his notes from the meeting for distribution later  today) One of Wright's key concern is forward contracting.
The utilities said that Loretta Lynch is the problem with the onerous  ""prudence"" criteria she's imposing on utility forward contracts.
Those onerous criteria keep the utility from contracting.
Much discussion of what California does on the gas side,  i.e., set an  objective benchmark price; if the utility beats it, they profit; if they do  worse, they take the hit.
The utility, under this framework, has broad  flexibility to contract forward, i.e., PUC gets out of the way.

332,"As you have heard, Dynegy is terminating the merger agreement today.
Among other things, this means we are now free to pursue other alternatives - which we are actively doing.
As a consequence of uncertainty about the deal - and now Dynegy's announcement - Enron's debt was downgraded to below investment grade levels today by S&P, Moody's and Fitch.
In response to this action, we have initiated a plan to protect value in our core trading and other energy businesses.
At the same time, we are nearing the completion of the business review process announced last week.
Once this process is complete, we will be conducting a comprehensive restructuring of our business.
Regrettably, but unavoidably, this will include the sale of non-core assets and the implementation of a comprehensive cost saving plan, including layoffs.
We are taking these actions to focus our resources on preserving the value of our core businesses, retaining our employees who are key to our future success, and maintaining relationships with our trading counterparties.
This must be our priority to establish a more solid footing for the rest of Enron.
I know you have serious concerns about what this all means for you.
Although, there are no guarantees, you should know that we are still in this fight and remain absolutely committed to protecting the value of the ongoing businesses of Enron.
All I can ask is that we all be supportive of each other, stay focused on our work as best we can, and stick together while we work to overcome these latest challenges.
Even six or so weeks ago, none of us could have imagined that we would be where we are today.
We will not recover in six weeks what we have lost, but we will work to stabilize and then rebuild this great company.
As always, I appreciate the extraordinary contributions each of you make.
Thank you.

","Update
"
333,"Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.
This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.
In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.
We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.
Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.
We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.
In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.
For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.
In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.
This quarter they are reported separately.
Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.
Following are the highlights of our businesses:  Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.
Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.
Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.
While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.
Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.
So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.
Transportation and Distribution: 	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.
This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.
Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.
This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.
Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.
Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.
This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.
Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions.
This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.
In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.
Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.
These charges include: ?
A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp. ?
$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.
This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?
$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.
With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

336,"As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.
Organizational Matters The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.
This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.
The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.
Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.
Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.
From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.
Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.
We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.
Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.
This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.
By now, you must have heard of ""NETCO.""
This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.
Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.
We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.
It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.
The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.
We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.
As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.
This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.
We will update you periodically on our process.
Personnel Matters As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.
Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.
Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.
Treasurer - Enron Corp Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.
In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.
Corporate Development Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.
In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.
Wholesale Services The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.
Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.
As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.
Management Committee Departures Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:  Michael Brown Mark Frevert Steve Kean Mike McConnell Jeff Shankman  Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.
We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.
Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.
We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.
We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

We appreciate people's concern= s about adding people and spending money at a time when we ought to be redu= cing unnecessary expenses.
Let us begin by saying that we share these conc= erns and are not hiring people or undertaking significant capital expenditu= res without a great deal of thought.
We would also encourage people to tal= k to their manager or either of us if you don't understand why we are doing=  certain things.
In short, we have decided to continue with the college re= cruiting, although we have not yet decided how many, if any, we will hire.

Why Are We Continuing With College Recruiting?
During the last few years we have made tremendous progress establishing a p= resence for Enron broadly and the Portland office specifically with leading=  schools in the northwest.
This past year we finally reached critical mass=  and had tremendous success in our recruiting efforts.
Although we are unc= ertain about our hiring needs this year, we feel that it is in our best lon= g term interest to continue having a presence with the schools in the north= west.
We have already made presentations and done initial screenings at mo= st schools.
We have identified the best people from each school and have a= lready made plans for them to come to our office for two super Saturdays.
= The cost to us to finish this process is not large compared to the benefit = that we gain from honoring our commitment to the schools and students as pa= rticipants in their on-campus recruiting programs.
We also realize that it=  is a hard year to be coming out of school looking for a job.
It is our be= lief that students would rather interview with us even if the possibilities=  of employment may be somewhat diminished.
Finally, we would like to empha= size the point that we have not yet committed to hiring anybody.
We will i= nterview people, identify the best candidates, and make hiring decisions ba= sed on the needs of the office.
Before extending offers we will consider t= he potential impact that it could have on people in this office and Enron e= mployees in other offices who have been redeployed.
Stated another way, we=  don't intend to hire a bunch of new people if there are people within Enro= n who could fill positions or if it would put the jobs of the people alread= y here at risk.
We may end up postponing hiring decisions until we are mor= e certain about the state of affairs in the company.
How Will the Floor Move Play Out?
We have decided to postpone the floor build out for a few weeks.
While we = still think that it makes sense for the office, we have decided to pause fo= r a couple of weeks before we start to spend significant amounts of money o= n this.
When talking to the build out team today it became clear that dela= ying would accomplish several goals.
First, it allows us to get final arch= itectural plans in place and firm quotes from contractors so that we can mo= re precisely peg down the costs before moving forward.
Second, it gives th= e build out team breathing room to iron out more of the details of the move= .
Finally, it buys us a little more time to decide whether or not it makes=  sense to do this project given the state of affairs of the company right n= ow.
While we still think that we are going to move forward with this proje= ct, it seems like buying a couple of weeks of time is the right thing to do=  right now.
In about two weeks we will reconvene with the build out team w= ith firm budget numbers and make a decision to either move ahead, cancel, o= r delay again.

If you have a notebook, and use it, please enter the date on the top of the page every time you start a shift.
Without that, your notes are pretty much worthless.
2.
Type a short note into the Scheduling Comments section of deals you zero out or change, especially if you're changing them much later than the time they were entered.
3.
Use the superfluity of spreadsheets, discussion databases, reports, Enpower applications, cut sheets, and other pieces of paper available to the Real Time group as evidence of your activity while on shift.
If this sounds unreasonable, I would welcome suggestions for an alternative.
Thanks for your help.

347,"FYI -  It appears the issue of how to execute inter-desk swaps is still not resolved.
I've attached the instructional worksheet Bill sent out awhile ago - it is actually a very coherent rendering of the intricacies involved in entering these enigmatic deals.
(Read: Inter-desk swaps are not real easy to understand.
This worksheet is.)
One tip: If STCA is long or short going into the Real Time market, they will have entered a purchase from or sale to the California Imbalance as a sort of ""place holder.""
An offsetting purchase or sale will need to be made under the STCA book in order to complete the deal and keep STCA flat.
If you're feeling ambitious and want to see the direct effects of putting deals in under the wrong book, run a Forward Obligation report (in Enpower Reports under the Risk tab) for the day, desk, and region in question.
If you did everything correctly, the report should produce nothing but zeroes.

349,"Welcome to Enron Center South.
As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.
Turret Users An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".
Increased Information Access There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.
To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:   Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	 Weather Channel	12401	801	 CNN Headlines News	12402	802	 CNN Financial News	12403	803	 CNBC	12404	804	 MSNBC	12405	805	 Bloomberg	12406	806	 Financial News Network	12407	807	 CNN	12408	808	 Fox Sports	12409	809	 ESPN1	12410	810	   Wireless Telephony You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.
We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.
The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.
Updates will be provided as they become available.
Keeping an Open forum We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

384,"jim,  sorry i could not stay in austin for the formal ""thank you"" to you for your leadership this past year.
i would add ""well done"" and please ""stay around""!
i would like to follow up on knowing whom i should contact, with your advance permission, for securing legal representation from enron corp. for the firm.
candidly does vicki sharp's position inhibit our serving in that capacity?
i know you approved us 2 years ago but we have not been contacted at all for representation.
we have turned down putative claims against enron for multiple reasons, even those where our role would not have been apparent.
i believe we can provide cost effective, quality representation in multiple areas of expertise (see our web site at www.gpsolaw.com) and enron would be well served.
let me know your thoughts, on a confidential basis, and i will act accordingly.
i enjoyed having lunch with carrin  as well and i wish you ""patience and luck"" on your home remodelling.
best personal regards,   roger

I am getting mixed information.
I know that we use the higher of the two volumes (receipts vs. deliveries).
The question is do we use the nom volume or the actual volume.
Last month (March), we left the volume at the nom of 45,000/day.
In the past , we have changed the volume to the actual daily volume.
For April, the actuals are higher than the nom and we would need to bump the volume up to 47,089/day.
James Armstrong is using the actual volume.
The deal for the fee is 514353.
My other problem is that the spreadsheet is choosing the max of three volumes, receipts, deliveries and transport.
Should the transport volume be in the calculation?
Also, Mark added some payback volume to the spreadsheet and it is being included in the receipt volume.
Do I include the payback volume in the calculation of the agency fee if we use the nom?
If you have a copy of the contract that addresses the agency fee, I would like to have a copy.

437,"Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.
The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:  ?
Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.
The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.
?
After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.
As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.
?
The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.
Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.
This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.
These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.

439,"John,  I met with Sasha today for approx.
3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.
Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):   - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book     to FPL (North Zone).
Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.
- Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.
The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.
(Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that    it is a purchase from Frontera.
Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)
- Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e.
- elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)   - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e.
- El Paso Merchant is actually APX)     So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.
- Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.
One less step that we need to worry about.
I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading ""time is of the essence"" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.
I hope this helps.

Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday  with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.
If  I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and  delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS'  fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .
That  argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of  warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?
At  minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to  get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.
But we heard nothing.

I called an old law  partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business  this week to have lunch and catch up.
This guy says he has come up with a  good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.
He's got an  80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development  in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in  service on July 1.
Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen.
Here's his racket:  1.
He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.
His  Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from  Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in  typical electric utility gold plated style).
He didn't say, but I suspect  there is no warranty on the units.
Obviously, this isn't a bold new  strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used  equipment.

449,"As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their  intent to close the merger.
Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing  date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.
Also,   until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come  undone.
If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust  between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.
Has Courtney got this covered?
I suspect he's been thrashing around so much  on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.
I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a  favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and  the merger closing.
(the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was  about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we  ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for  us if the merger goes south for some reason.

455,"Please take a look at Vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW  using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern.
You'll recall that  Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the  calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate  customer imbalances, by month.
Proving once again that TW is just a little  different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW.
I agree with Vig's  conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing.
I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a  correlation.
Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities  that occur early and late in a month.
Please tell me if you agree, marketing  folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb  opportunites.
In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell  the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate  arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index  will be at the end of the month.
In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on  the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the  monthly index will be, is basically free money.
Using that logic, I ignored  any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month.
I eyeballed  the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb  opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than  using Steve's mathematical approach.
I still didn't see the kind of  correlation I'd expect.
The correlation is directionally positive in only 4  out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in  the months that correlate on direction.
I give up, and am removing the arb  argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft.
I'll route that  separately.
Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.

Please note that the first two transactions are already  public and the following information can be disclosed now.
The third deal  has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.
That filing will  be made before Dec. 1, 2000.
General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's  maximum tariff rate.
Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated  rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.
(Order issued April 11, 1997,  Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par.
61,021).
Pursuant to that authority,  TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed  at Docket No.
RP97-288.
Details on the specific transactions are as follows:    Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading  Rate Schedule:  ITS-1  Volume:    30,000/day  Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges  Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000  Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool  Delivery point:  SoCal Topock  Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000  and rate is $.75/MMBtu    Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading  Rate Schedule:  LFT  Volume:  10,000/day  Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges  Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000  Receipt point:  Bloomfield  Delivery point:  PG&E Topock  All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these  transactions.
No other information is available as TW does not comment on  specific customer transactions.

462,"This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at  downstream points.
Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to  tender fuel to us at their receipt points.
With rare exceptions, those  receipt points are not at the Cal.
border.
Order 636 mandates that pipelines  unbundle transportation from storage.
It also requires that pipelines that  make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.
That  latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point ""x"", it should  resell the gas at point ""x"" and not haul the gas to point ""y"" and then sell  it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.
My concern this morning was  that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that  gas to the Cal.
border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement  (because the Cal.
border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the  transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the ""furthest  upstream point"" requirement or both.
Susan and my recollection was that when  ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than  Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where  they wanted it.
I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling  that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around  whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.
The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.
Prior Claim (1997-1999)  On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.
During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69 Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99 Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler  Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.
Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.

I think we probably will need to get the information for all the Appalachian producers.
I also realize that it may take some time for you to get the EES information together.
Over 70% of the Dominion volumes are for ENA.
1.
Pre petition amounts due by production month for EES and ENA by pipeline.
2.
Detail all deals that have pricing other than index for the total volume.
If a deal has tiered pricing, then I need to know how much gas flowed for that deal.
Ex:  Triad where the first 5,000 is at $4.48 and anything over that is at index.
I would need to know the total volume by month on this deal.
3.
Pre petition and post petition transportation expenses.
Rita has put this information together for ENA.
I will start it for EES and then get you or Kathryn to help me.

489,"Hey guys!
It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.
Just thought you might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the English language.
Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.
There are differences between British English and American English that I've noticed so far:  Pants are ""trousers.""
Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, ""Black Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants"" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in ""trousers"" not pants with a smirk.
""Pants"" are what they call underwear here.
Also, I almost fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said ""PANTS!""
and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.
Apparentely, it's the equivalent of saying ""CRAP!""
I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some orange juice.
On the outside of some of the containers it said ""with extra bits"" and some said ""no bits.""
I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained that it was ""with pulp"" or ""without pulp.""
When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are ""chips"" on the menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called ""crisps.""
If you want to get a baked potato it's called a ""jacket potato.""
And if you want mashed potatoes, just say ""mash.""
One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) here is ""bangers and mash"" which translates to sausages links and mashed potatoes.
Here are a few more of the oddities:  You don't stand in line here, you ""stand in queue.""
Trash cans are ""bins.""
It's amusing to hear someone say, ""I don't want it- just bin it.""
Country boy or redneck types are called ""wide boys"" or ""barrow boys.""
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced ""zed"" and H is pronounced ""haitch.""
Cross walks are ""zebra crossings""  since they are signified by white stripes on the road.
(Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra) Panty hose are called ""tights"" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced ""goote.""
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.
Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.
I hope you are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.
Cheers!
( ""Thanks"")
