Additionally, it is getting close to closing.
I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible.
We can handle this in two ways.
I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).

3,"To our IBS Customers that are still hanging in there:  We understand your continued frustration and express our sincerest apologies for our inability to give complete and accurate answers to your questions.
The problems that we are seeing are one of three (3) possibilities:  1)  You have entered your password incorrectly (or what you thought was the correct password) and been given the error message that you have exceeded your opportunities for today, and you receive the message ""You have failed to correctly login three times today; please try again tomorrow, or contact the bank at 830-379-5236 to have your password reset.""
This is the easiest problem to correct and we can fix this one quickly with you online (on the phone).
Should you receive this message, please call our Computer Department and ask for either myself (Howard Gordon) @ 830-401-1185, Christina Kirby @ 830-401-1189, or Lora Robles @ 830-401-1182.
If you reach our voice mail (or another employee), please leave your Name, Account # and call back #.
2)  You are not using the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder).
Please try again using the last six (6) digits, or call us to determine who we have recorded as the primary account holder.
3)  If you see this error message ""Invalid login; please try again"" (after three [3] or more tries), then you possibly fall into this last category.
Your account is one of the few that did not convert correctly (we will not release any information about these accounts until we verify that all information is correct and accurate).
We are finalizing these accounts today and should have them available for access this afternoon (late) or this evening.
Once we release these accounts for IBS access, you will have to again use the last six (6) digits of your ssn# (this is the ssn# or tin# of the primary account holder), then you will be directed to a screen that asks for information such as:  Name Address City, State Zip+4 Phone # E-Mail Address  After entering this information and clicking submit, you will then be instructed to change your password to anything that you desire (you can at this point change your password back to what it was before).

8,"To all of our esteemed & prized Internet Banking  (IBS) Clients:  You probably have begun to wonder does anyone ever return phone calls (or e-mails).
We really do but have been holed up trying to complete this project ASAP.
We knew that this might upset some clients, but we found that this is the quickest way to fix this problem and get our users back on-line.
We have finalized the movement of your customer account #s and re-linked your additional accounts back to your primary Login ID (Acct #).
This process was more daunting than we anticipated and having to verify 1100 IBS users and account #s (to insure your data integrity and confidentiality) was even more grueling than expected.
After verifying data and Login IDs, we believe that we are on the right track.
Some of you (our IBS clients) might notice your accounts displayed more than once or additional accounts displayed that you may (or may not) want displayed on your IBS screen.
Should this be the case, please e-mail (or phone) the information to us and we will remove this information right away.
To our IBS Billpayer clients:  During this process, we seem to have misplaced (blown away) your bill payment information (particularly anyone that has [had] reoccurring payments scheduled to process on particular days).
This has become our highest priority to retrieve this information, thus alleviating the process of having to request that our IBS Billpayers re-enter this information.
We are going to waive all bill payment charges for the months of November & December, 2001 to try and regain your confidence (and support).
Again, we deeply express our regrets and hope that we (yourselves and ourselves) do not have to go through this process again.
Should you be one of our IBS clients that still has not gained access to your account information, please refer to the following information:

15,"Liane,   As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to  manipulate the  El Paso San Juan monthly index.
A single buyer entered the  marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices  ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
At the  time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15  cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to  report into the index calculation.
Additionally, these trades are out of  line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.
We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from  September 25 to September 27.
These are the complete list of trades from  Enron Online (EOL), Enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage  firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).
Please see the attached spreadsheet for a  trade by trade list and a summary.
We have also included a summary of gas  daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread  relationships.
The two key points from this data are as follows:   1.
The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater  than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days.
2.
The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &  Northwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and         October gas daily.
It doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that  are dramatically different.
I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
Hopefully, the  trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to  determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are  outliers.
I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in  establishing a reasonable index.
It is Enron's belief that the trades at  $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the  calculation of index.
It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to  conduct our physical and financial business.
Please contact me  anytime I can assist you towards this goal.
Sincerely,
",San Juan Index

17,"Gentlemen  I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.
We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.
Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.
They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.
They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.
To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.
Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.
Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.
The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.
Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.
Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.
Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.
All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.
Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.
The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.
The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.
I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.
I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.
Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.
We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.
Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.
If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.
The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.
Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.
Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.
So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.
Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.
Regards

25,"The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.
This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).
I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.
For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).
A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).
Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""
She replies:	""No.""
As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.
So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.
The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.
The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.
There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""  Date & Time Saturday November 3rd.
We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.
The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.
Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April.
Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building.
Right before that building is Elm Street.

34,"Hey John!
How are you??
I've been following the Enron story closely, which means I've thought of you a lot recently.
I hope things are going well, despite the uncertainty.
I ran into someone from our Enron days today, which made me think of a funny story.
Do you remember when John Mee tried to eat 8 Big Macs and hurled instead?
John was talking to my boss, Chuck Clough, today, who he's known since childhood and is a mentor of sorts.
When he got off the phone, Chuck told me who he was talking to and the name John Mee struck me as familiar.
I asked Chuck if he was a big kid who'd gone to Harvard and he said yes.
So I tell him the Big Mac story and Chuck picks up the phone and calls John to ask him if that was him because if so, I knew him.
Poor thing says ""yeah, that was me, but not one of my finer moments...""  I could tell he was embarrassed.
I guess there are some things in life you just never live down.
I also ran into some friends of yours in Bermuda last month.
We shared a cab to the airport and realized we had all been at Enron, though not at the same time.
I mentioned that I really loved the company, especially how young it was and that I had a friend who joined right out of undergrad and is now doing really well.
They immediately said ""John Arnold!""
Shocked the hell out of me, honestly.
They were very funny in saying that I had made a ""bad trade"" by marrying my husband instead of you.
I told them I would keep that in mind....  ;-}  I would tell you their names, but I can't remember off the top of my head.
They both work for a weather trading firm in the Northeast now, with Lynda Clemmons.
Well, gotta run to the gym - been putting it off as long as I could today.
I really do hope you're doing well.
Please drop me a line when you aren't trading up a storm...

35,"John and Dutch -  This email is sent to discuss what is needed with respect to NYMEX quotes from the broker market.
Simply put, we need quotes on every forward term for which we currently have positions.
It seems that the best way to obtain relevant information would be to ask for the following:  1.
Annual quotes (a quote for 2003, a quote for 2004, etc.)
2.
Seasonal quotes (winter '03, summer '04, etc.)
In short, try to obtain pricing to match any positions which we currently have in the books.
I know that this will be difficult to accomplish, but please do what you can.
We need these quotes for every day starting with Nov 28 through today.
We will continue to need daily updates for the immediate future.
Also, I am aware that our current position doesn't give us much stroke to ask for a lot of pricing data.
However, this information is critical as it will be needed for calculation of termination values.
Please do whatever you can to obtain as much data as possible.
Additionally, we need to get quotes from as many different brokers as possible to help verify pricing.
Please let me know if the brokers are not accomodating your requests; we may need to ask John or Louise to place calls into the brokers to move this process along.
If you have any questions or comments, you can normally find me in the ""war room"" next to Louise's office.
If I'm not there, please call me at (713) 927-3003 or at ext 53923.

44,"I am changing the way the curve is generated starting in Jan 2004 to better  replicate seasonal fundamentals.
There are convincing arguments as to why  the summer/winter spreads should tighten over time.
However, in the previous  methodology they blew out.
For instance summer/winter in Cal 3 was .232  while Cal 10 was .256.
I have added a seasonality dampening function that both contracts the  summer/winter spread and applies a premium to the electric load demand months  of July and August over time.
The formula for the curve remains the same except for a premium lookup for  the month as well as for the year.
These premiums are as follows:  Jan  -.008 Feb -.004 Mar -.001 Apr .002 May .003 Jun .004 Jul .004 Aug .004 Sep .003 Oct .002 Nov -.003 Dec -.006   These premiums start in Jan 2004 On Wednesday Jan 2003 settled 2.959,  the 3/4 spread was marked at .0375, the  4/5 spread was marked at .0475.
In the old methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 = 2.9965 Jan 2005  =          2.9965 + .0475 = 3.044   In the new methodology Jan 2003  = 2.959 Jan 2004  = 2.959 + .0375 - .008 =2.9885 Jan 2005  = 2.9885 + .0475 -.008 = 3.028  The only change in the formula is from: Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table to Month x = Month (x- 1 year) + lookup on year on year table + lookup on month  premium table  The seasonality premiums will change over time and I will let you know when I  change them

I also quoted the SERC 7000 call at $1 over our mid, at $3.98/KW-mo for 1 yr and $4.12/KW-mo for 4 yrs, again with 5x16 and 16 hour mins.

If absolutely not available for 4hr 		min run time, see if we can do 8hr min.
If this is absolutely not possible, let's try 		to quote day-ahead 8hr min at the very least.

53,"Harry, Iris and Brandon:  I asked ConEd if they were prepared to hear our OFFER to buy peaking capacity from the Lakewood expansion.
They are ""in the midst of preparing a draft term sheet for purchasing the output/tolling"" so we'll have to wait to see the parameters of sale.
I also asked if they would like to see PJM WEST synthetic toll offer from us.
Unfortunately, NO.
To the extent it matters, the on-line date is now set for late 2002, so they would like to see our offer for a Jan '03 start date.
Given that these guys are doing a real comparison against bricks and mortar, we would be looking at a $63 million option premium for 500MW @ 3.50/KW-mo over a three-year term; $84 million for a four-year term, I would hope we could be able to find a way to hedge the risk of too many $500 hours killing us.
Is there any cap we could buy to protect our downside risk here and still make this deal attractive?

54,"Harry and Brandon:   Just to memorialize what I just communicated to Harry over the phone.
My interface at TVA emailed yesterday requesting a phone dialogue to discuss where our Synthetic Peaker offer needs to be for TVA to execute.
Holding all assumptions constant, we would need to come in between $2.25-$2.30/KW-month in order for TVA to execute.
Our indicative quote was $3.90/KW-month.
I will attempt to find out if they have other offers in the sub-$2.50 range or if they are just setting their own bid at the requested price.

Rationale: The TYZ/TYH roll will be impacted by a number of factors.
Most important, we believe, will be changes in the contract's cheapest-to-deliver caused by market movements.
Changes in CTD will change the amount of net positive carry that is the primary determinant of the TYZ/TYH roll's value.
For example, The TYZ/TYH roll priced using the 6.5% 2/10 has 35.75/32 of net carry, while the roll priced with the 4.7% 11/08 has only 28.5/32 of net carry.

Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.
While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.
We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.
However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.
We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.
We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.
Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.

142,"Celeste,  I am writing to get some clarification on how the recent changes to the  program affect my eligibility for promotion.
At the end of last year you  informed me that I was not eligible for promotion to associate until the mid  year review (my 2 year anniversary).
It was my impression that the only  reason that I was held back from promotion into the associate program was  tenure.
Now, after reading the memo, it seems as if I will not be eligible  for promotion to associate until I complete 3 years in the program.
I am wondering if I am still eligible for promotion to associate during this  PRC?

60% of this value should be credited to Greg's Transport expense on a monthly  basis.
Tom, in turn, will cover Ed on this portion of the expense.
For example:  Accrual Value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of April.
This means that:  Greg's portion of this value is 60% of $300,000 = $180,000 Tom's portion of this value is 40% of $300,000 = $120,000  Greg's Transport Expense is ($700,000) So, Tom will cover                      $180,000 of this expense Greg's adjusted Expense is   ($520,000)  Greg's P&L is net better off by the $180,000 of accrual value Tom's P&L is net better off by $120,000  of accrual value which had not been  previously recognized.

196,"Fellas:   Enjoyed the weekend with you all immensely.
I  think Travis and Don Jr. are my new benchmarks for late night longevity, and  Don.
Sr. is my new benchmark for marksmanship from a seated position.
I want to make you all aware of a new organization  that I have helped start up.
The Saltwater Conservation Association of  Texas was founded to give Texans a new conservation resource that is dedicated  solely to the coast of Texas.
We are a 501 (c) 3, non-profit, and we have no paid  staff.
Our goal for the next 3-5 years is to assist TPWD in their effort  to retire as many commercial shrimping licenses as possible, as Texas shrimpers  now accumulate around 80 million pounds of bycatch annually.
This bycatch  includes an incredible amount of flounder and croaker, not to mention numerous  forage fish for trout and reds.
We are an authorized agent of TPWD, whereby we can  solicit bids from shrimpers, purchase their license, and then hand it over to  TPWD.
The program is intended to target bay shrimping (not bait shrimping)  as the bay shrimpers drag their nets for hours on end, whereas the bait  shrimpers usually only drag for around 20 minutes or so.
To make a long  story short, the effect of thousands of chains dragging across the bays on a  daily basis is not good for the ecosystem.
I hope you will all consider becoming a Founding  Father.
If not, then any level of sponsorship is certainly  appreciated.
Details of our organization and sponsorship levels can be  found at our website - www.scatexas.org  -  or you can call direct at 512-392-1256.
You can join online or print an  application and mail it in.
Thanks for your consideration, and once again I  really enjoyed the weekend with you all.
Take care.

The work is designed to improve performance and expandability for the future.
We were hoping to utilize the Thanksgiving holiday to perform some of this work.
What we need from you guys is permission to have some agreed upon downtime for Enpower over the holidays so we can run some clean-up jobs on the database.
However, we do need to execute the jobs in such a way as to have a minimal impact on the Real Time trading desks.
Here is our plan as was previously discussed with David Poston:  Wed Nov 21, 8pm - 10pm Central (6pm - 8pm Portland), for unrelated hardware maintenance  Beginning Saturday thru Sunday, rolling 3 hour outages: (NOTE:  during the below times, the system may not actually be totally down, but error messages may occur so don't be alarmed)  Starting Saturday morning at 10am (8am Portland Time) we will be contacting the East & West Real Time Desks to determine if they can afford a 3 hour down-time window.
When the clean-up job is completed, we will contact the related desks that the Enpower application is now available.
We will then want to keep the environment stable for at least an hour to allow the traders to catch up from the down-time.
We will repeat this process during the following time periods.
Saturday, November 24nd from 10am (8am Portland) - Saturday, November 24th @ 6pm (4pm Portland) Saturday, November 24nd from 8pm (6pm Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 8am (6am Portland) Sunday, November 25th from 10am (8am Portland) - Sunday, November 25th @ 6pm (4pm Portland)

212,"The last I heard, the MISO is supposed to begin offering service on their OASIS tomorrow for service starting January 1.
I wanted to let all of you know a bit about where we stand with regards to that process.
I have been working with several different folks here and at the MISO to ensure that we are ready to do business with the MISO and request service.
The MISO OASIS seems to be accepting our Tradewave Certs, so we just need to get our MISO login for their systems.
Today, the MISO will be sending out logins to their systems via FedEx, and should arrive prior to 10am.
Christi Nicolay will be receiving this information and distributing it as soon as it arrives.
Unfortunately, the MISO has been (as you probably know) cutting things closer and closer to the edge.
This login was supposed to be delivered a couple weeks ago, but they have just gotten around to sending it out.
Hopefully, we will not have any problems with it once it arrives.
As I understand it, there should be only one login set up for ""EPMI 24-Hour Operations,"" with a login of ""Enron.""
The password is currently only known by the MISO, but should be contained in the letter we receive tomorrow.
This login is a temporary one until we complete our final registration.
This final registration has been a bit more of a pain, as it has involved contractual agreements and credit obligations.
I am still working with our Legal, Credit, and AP folks to get everything set up.
Again, the MISO sent the final documents out fairly recently, and we have not had a great amount of time to review, analyze, and negotiate their terms.
Hopefully, we will have come to agreement with MISO about those items, and be able to file that final application soon.
If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach me at my desk (X53771) or via my cellular (713-927-4680).
Obviously, you can also call Christi (X37007) or Susan Lindberg (X30596) as well.

RT01-98-000) at its December 19th meeting, Allegheny Power (AP) will need to delay the start of the PJM West arrangement until March 1, 2002.
In order to accommodate the further delay in the start date, AP will need to sell transmission service under the AP OATT and on the AP OASIS for the month of February 2002.
To accomplish this, AP will do the following:  *	AP will attempt to call the Transmission Customers that have ""confirmed"" point-to-point transmission service reservations on the PJM OASIS for the paths that are not currently valid for PJM (AEP and DLCO) by 4:30 p.m. on December 21 to determine if they need comparable service on the AP system.
If that is the case, AP will honor the ""confirmed"" reservations and the PJM OASIS timestamps.
*	Yearly service that was not given the option to exercise roll-over rights on the PJM paths (AP to PJM and PJM to AP) will be given the option to extend that service through the month of February.
AP will attempt to call these Transmission Customers by 4:30 p.m. on December 21.
*	ATCs for the month of February will be uploaded to the AP OASIS starting at 8 a.m. on December 24.
The upload will include all valid AP paths (AEP, PJM, VAP, FE and DLCO).
*	Transmission Marketing will post a message on the OASIS when the ATC upload is started and when it is complete.
*	Transmission service beyond March 1, 2002, will continue to be sold by PJM per the Interim Coordination Agreement that was filed with FERC on February 12, 2001.
*	January 30, 2002, is the last scheduled FERC meeting in January.
If FERC does not act on our filing at that time, the start of the PJM West arrangement may then be delayed until April 1, 2002.
Further information will be provided at that time, if necessary.

239,"Looks like we have an issue with RisktRAC access.
In order to be able to set up books in RisktRAC, the only role that currently exists is the Risk Controls group, who has access to all books, hierarchies etc (all groups, all commodities).
With NetCo coming on line, the Risk Controls group has been asked to approve RisktRAC access to the new NetCo controls group so they can set up the new gas books that have been requested.
I am uncomfortable granting access to NetCo personnel, as they would be able to see all the estate info, including Europe, EIM, EGM, ENA etc.
Also, it is my understanding that the IT groups are working on splitting out the systems but will not be able to do so until after these books have to be set up (deadline for them is next Monday).
As such, I recommend the following:   In order to ensure there is a segration between NetCo and the estate, until the systems are segregated, the IT groups should be responsible for setting up books, curves etc.
How does that sound?

241,"Want to clarify if the Estate has the right to do a services deal with a 3r= d party with our copy of the licenses after the NetCo deal is done.
=20 =20 Here is the issue (as per an old draft of the Assignment and License Agreem= ent).
=20 In the current deal, Enron assigns, sells, transfers and conveys to NetCo a= ll of the rights, title and interest in and to the software and intellectua= l property rights.
In other words, NetCo will be the owner of the Enron de= veloped applications or software including EOL, TAGG, ERMS, DCAF, Sitara, U= nify, EnPower, etc.
Enron or the estate gets back a worldwide, perpetual, = irrevocable, nonexclusive, fully paid-up, royalty free license of all of th= em for any purpose.
I am not sure why the original deal was done this way = as opposed to Enron continuing to own all the software and just granting a = perpetual, royalty free license to all the applications to NetCo, but I rea= lize we are in the 11th hour.
=20 What it also says is that Enron shall not have the right to grant any subli= cense to any third party for use within the field of ""wholesale trading of = natural gas and electricity within North America.""
It also says that NetCo=  can't, as long as Enron owns 20% of NetCo, assign or license the software = to any third party or use the software for any of the prohibited commoditie= s. =20 Is trading the act of buying and selling of the commodities?
Once a NetCo = deal is completed, we want to have NetCo and the estate agree that trading = is buying and selling, not service or fulfillment.
I would like the Estate=  to maintain the right and ability to sub-license all the applications asso= ciated with logistics and settlement (not EOL or those systems associated w= ith buying and selling and order capture) to a third party that would have = the opportunity to build a mid and back office processing and service busin= ess around those sub-licenses in all commodities, including gas and power i= n North America.
The Estate may even outsource to this 3rd party and take = back a service agreement from this 3rd party as well as some of the future = profit it generates from this service company.
This would allow the estate=  to get value for the applications and associated employees on a service de= al.
NetCo should not be concerned about fulfillment as being defined as co= mpetition.
Also, the estate is keeping CommodityLogic and it is much more = valuable as a tool within a complete services entity.
=20 I have not heard whether the final purchase and sale agreement has a non-co= mpete or not.
If there is not one, then doing the above should be no issue.
=20 Need an answer quick on if we need to change anything or if you think that = we have this right as written or if you think NetCo has an issue.

",Summary of Meeting
243,"George -  This note is to confirm that Murray O'Neil's latest expense report (roughly $2,000) was for valid,  POST-petition business.
He travels from Portland where he is based, to Houston, as needed, to work on Power settlements and volume management for EES, and these expenses are for airfare, hotel and meals for the week prior to the Christmas holiday.
Per our discussion, I assume that these were held up by the system due to the $5,000 limitation, for further review.
Please have a member of your team expedite the review of this expense report, so that it can be released today, if possible.
I assume that they will confirm to us that the report has been released so that Murray will no longer be behind in his expense reimbursements, since he will be traveling to Houston again (and therefore incurring expenses) on Monday.
I understand that Enron is not issuing cash advances, but that once the initial backlog of expense processing is done, that reimbursement will occur much more quickly, now that we are in the post-petition environment.

This creates several issues that we must address:  Did AEP purchase any systems and/or contracts?
Are these employees still located in our office and if so are they assuming the building lease and associated expenses?
Do they still have access to our systems?
Who, if anyone, was not included in the AEP purchase?
Many of the deals were executed under ECTRIC - Nordic Branch; is this treated similar to ECTRIC?
Since ECTRIC still has not declared bankruptcy, we need to evaluate these portfolios immediately.
We probably do not have Commercial leadership in Oslo; therefore, we need to develop an action plan for that office.

254,"Greg,  Just as a follow up to our conversation, I have serious concerns about the estate's ability to service IT requests.
The number of people that remain in the estate, that understand the gas and power systems, is limited (and we're receiving resignations now).
With this in mind, I would like to have the ability to outsource the IT department (applications, infrastructure) and potentially the back office staff to a consulting company (potentially Accenture or CGEY).
We would need to move the estate employees into this company and incentivize them to stay.
The consulting company could then supplement the staff and the Enron estate employees could now have a career path at the consulting company.
To make this deal attractive, the consulting company would like to have the ability to create a services company and offer IT and fulfillment and processing services to other companies.
By the way, this could be done for other commodities outside gas and power.
The deal would have to include royalty payments to the estate for each additional services agreement.
The intent is to make the services company into a thriving business.
We would also want to sell Commodity Logic (IP included) to round out the services offering.
We could consider selling the IP to our EGM and EIM systems as well.
All in all, the intent is to bring value to the estate and support the estate while the businesses wind down or start up.
We must make sure that the NETCO agreement allows the estate to license the gas and power software in some capacity and continue to develop the applications.
As an aside, the estate cannot perform on the Bridgeline or AEP deals.
There are not enough resources that fully understand the system, therefore, we cannot maintain a fully operational production quality system.
These deals must either be moved to NETCO or we need to find another alternative (the above referenced services company or selling the software to AEP and Bridgeline).
I know this is long winded, but I needed to get these points down on paper.
I am on vacation next week, but can be reached on my cell phone at 713-240-0919 or at my house in Kiawah at 843-768-6651.

",Cash Forecast
256,"Greg (Adams), Attached is our cash forecast.
There are several important points to keep in mind with this forecast: 1.
This is our best guess at this point.
As other business units clarify their business plans, it will affect our activity.
Once their plans are set and communicated to us, we can better forecast our numbers.
2.
This forecast represents the estate only.
(Since that is what we discussed in the meeting on Monday)  We have made no attempt to forecast NETCo since that has already been done and is seperate.
3.Infrastructures numbers are somewhat soft due to the Outlook problems experienced yesterday.
As they firm up or we get additional information, we can update numbers.
4.
We have not included any future severance or retainage payments as we discussed.

For Energy Operations, that is usually very easy since there has been no revenues, and all of the costs are allocated out, so there should be zero EBIT if nothing changed.
Given your present direction, however, you may be generating some margin in 2001.

267,"In order to maximize the potential synergies between the various mid- and back- office functions, to decrease replication errors, and to increase communication standards; are there any plans of creating a platform or reference center to bridge the differences between the systems, processes, and terminology of the various departments.
Perhaps a common resource center offering access to on-line system manuals and business unit overviews (which currently exist only in paper form or in some cases within the actual system database).
The reason: With Enron's size and transaction volume, many of the functions and the data managed by various groups within Enron (i.e.
credit, risk, settlements, volume management, global contracts, global counterparties, global rates, and the commercial systems) are fragmented.
Having participated in various process reviews and trouble-shooting/clean-up projects there seems to be a large disconnect between groups operating in various systems.
These disconnects; rather they be lack of information or understanding of how data flows between systems, how the data managed within each system impacts other upstream or downstream systems, or how the business processes within one group/system impacts the overall functionality of other groups, create large cracks producing an opportunity for mismanaged data, incomplete business reports, and increased risk to Enron.
The ideal objective; increase communication standards through a better understanding of system data functions/requirements and business processes, decrease system downtime and replication errors through a better understanding of the data relationships between systems, maximize department-to-department synergies (left hand knows what the right hand is doing), eliminate repetition, and further reduce potential risks to Enron due to information/business process oversight.

282,"The following is an update of the last two meetings of the FASB and decisions made regarding goodwill and intangible assets:  The Board reiterated that they intend to release the statement in final form in June 2001 despite publicity to the contrary.
The Board decided that goodwill should be tested for impairment annually rather than on an events-and-circumstances basis as previously proposed.
Additionally, goodwill should be tested for impairment during interim periods if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its book value.
It should also be tested for impairment on an interim basis when (1) a more-likely-than-not expectation exists that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of, or (2) a significant asset group within a reporting unit is tested for recoverability under SFAS 121.
The Board changed the proposed method for determining the amount of goodwill to be included in the net assets to be disposed of.
Under the new method, a portion of the reporting unit's goodwill will be allocated to all divestitures.
I do not believe that the Board gave full consideration to all of the issues surrounding this decision.
In particular, they did not address application to divestitures that result in a loss prior to or as a result of goodwill allocation and disposals of equity, cost or fair value method investments.
additionally, the calculation itself is arbitrary and onerous in that fair values of the reporting unit and its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities will have to be determined each time a divestiture is done.
I will be consulting with AA on this to see if they can encourage the Board to give thought to these issues prior to releasing the final statement since they do not intend to discuss the issue further at this time.
The Board changed the proposed method of allocating goodwill upon an acquisition to allow for allocation of goodwill in an acquisition to a reporting unit even if none of the assets or liabilities of the acquired company have been allocated to that reporting unit.

284,"The Board decided in today's meeting to delay the effective date for adoption of the goodwill and intangible asset portion of the business combinations exposure draft to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, permitting early adoption for fiscal years beginning after March 31, 2001 if financial statements for the first quarter have not yet been reported.
This means that goodwill amortization will continue through year-end.
Discussion is continuing on when the first impairment analysis will be required given the new adoption date and whether or not initial impairments may be reported as a change in accounting principle.
Adoption of the business combinations portion of the exposure draft is still anticipated to be required for acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2001.
The main implication of this is that more excess purchase price is expected to be allocated to identifiable intangible assets rather than goodwill for acquisitions completed after this date.
The pooling-of-interests method of accounting for business combinations is still anticipated to be eliminated as of June 30, 2001.
",Goodwill Exposure Draft
285,"There seems to be some confusion around which DPR captures credit reserve and consumption premium reserves and which balance sheet these items fall on.
My understanding in talking with both Don and Kevin is that since EES is, on a go-forward basis, being granted origination (which would be the residual after all reserves are applied) that all prudency/reserve items will rest on the WhEES DPR.
The EES DPR will be just a single line net origination number.
We do need to capture the activity related to DSM in the EES DPR (including some portion of credit reserve and drift) but until we have the system capability to capture this it may just have to be part of the whole WhEES bucket.
This tracks with the idea that all future exposures (be they be wholesale price movement, tariff movement, credit exposure, etc.)
be borne by EWS.
If so, they need the reserves to properly offset any realized activity.
The balance sheet reserves associated with these items already rest in the ledgers that are rolling up underneath EWS now.
Reflecting the positions on the WhEES DPR will make them consistent with how we are capturing them from an accounting perspective.
If anyone disagrees with this treatment, please respond to all the parties above so we can resolve this issue.
If there are no objections I would recommend moving the credit reserve over at the next possible point.
Wade  P.S.
This thinking only reflects how things are currently contemplated, if the mix around what is with EWS vs. EES (i.e., accounts receivable) we may want to rethink the credit reserve portion.
",Credit Reserve
286,"I am due to get the revised Risk Management reorganization groupings this afternoon.
At that point, additional cost centers may need to be set up so it will probably be the first of next week before any transfers could begin to happen.
Given that it will be the third week of May at that point, the effective date will probably have to be June 1, 2001 for SAP cost center reporting (correct)?
In any event, to enable us to have as clean a cut-off as possible for financial reporting purposes, I would like to wait and make these moves effective July 1, 2001.
That way their existing cost centers are pure for a full quarter and the new cost centers start off clean in a new quarter.
This will also help us from a planning perspective in developing a clean go-forward budget for these groups.
This will have no impact on our financial reporting, we will simply allocate costs to EWS from EES, rather than EES receive a charge from EWS for the entire second quarter.
Unless I hear strong objection to this, we will work toward a July 1, 2001 cutover.

287,"This mail is the third in the series regarding the acceptance of RiskTrac VaR for UK Power.
Please see the previous 2 days which will provide the history.
Essentially we have now reached the stage where we can explain the jump in VaR from moving from the VaR spread sheet to RiskTrac based largely on the good work that Fergus Trenholme - London Risk Management and Stig Faltinsen - London Research have done  (it has been a team effort as many others have been called in as appropriate and I would like to thank them too).
A full analysis is contained in the note from Fergus and Stig below but the key points to note are:  the changing of the input parameters partially explains the difference in the VAR number between the 2 systems but not completely (including the change in factor loadings) the vast majority of the difference in the VAR numbers between the 2 systems is caused by the splitting of the volumetric position into the (primary and secondary) component curves in RiskTrac.
In RiskTrac PPP is currently set as the primary curve even though 75% of the position is on the station gate curve where as in the spreadsheet the whole position is against the PPP curve  As a result of us now being able to isolate and explain the jump in VaR from moving to RiskTrac we will be reporting this number from now on.
That said does the VaR number sound right ?
The numer is theoretically but is the theory close to reality in the Uk Power market ?The RiskTrac calculated $25m VaR is a 1 day VaR and the  methodology would imply it should be broken 1 in 20 business days.
Based on historical P&Ls this has not been the case and so it does not pass the ""sense check"".
(note that the original $13m VaR was only broken once or twice in the last year).
There are many potential explanations why, but if we think about how the price and volatility curves move they typically only move at the short end (ie only the first 2 years) and the component VarR for this period is in the order of $8m.
This could therefore imply that the volatilities we are using to calculate the VaR are too high.
The book undoubtedly contains significant risk but due to market illiquidity more consideration should be given to ""jumps"" or ""shocks"".
The book does posses increased fat tail risk at this lower VaR level which is not  captured in the current VaR calculation.
Outstanding issues / work  Based on the second bullet point above consideration needs to be given to changing the primary and secondary curve settings as well as the correlations and factor loadings for and between all the curves.
The impact of any such changes will need to be quantified.
Fergus and Stig aim to work with Houston research and the business on this over the next few days / week(s) and will be providing a regular update to those on this mail list.
Additional work needs to done to assess whether the VaR  number  / methodology being calculated / employed by RiskTrac truly represents the expected volatility and performance of the portfolio and truly represents the 1 day earnings risk for 19 out of 20 days.
It would also be appropriate, given the nature of the market and the term structure of the portfolio, to assess the fat tail risk being run.
I am away for the next 2 weeks so Fergus and Stig will be sending regular progress updates.

305,"As I look back on the ten months that I have been the Business Controller for EIM and challenged to build the mid and back office infrastructure, the most significant accomplishments are:  Systems - Tactical systems have been implemented to bridge the business while strategic systems are developed.
Financial and physical confirmations (with the exception of Lumber) have been predominantly automated.
Financial settlements has been automated.
Implemented modified versions of LISA to handle physical movements and settlements.
Bridges have been built to SAP and Credit Aggregation systems.
People - Ten months ago, the mid and back office had three employees, with the remaining efforts supported by Global Markets.
Today, we have an enthusiastic, energetic team of 41 employees.
The team includes our London office also.
We continue to recruit for additional positions.
Processes and Controls - Many processes and controls have been developed to ensure accurate and timely reporting of P&L and positions, confirmations and settlements.
Some of these tools include: Pulp and Paper Deal Ticket (Access Database) - Ten months ago, deal tickets were generated through an Excel template and no master copy or controls were in place.
Today, traders, Risk, Confirms, Settlements, Credit, Logistics, etc.
can view the deal tickets in a controlled and timely manner.
LISA/TAGG Reconciliation (Access Database) - When the onset of physical business and the implementation of LISA systems, physical transactions for all commodities (except lumber) are entered into 2 systems - LISA and TAGG.
This tool provides a reconciliation tool that allows the Risk system and the logistics/settlements systems to stay in sync.
Trader Training Tools - Two different presentations have been developed and presented to the EIM trading community to help the traders (mostly new to Enron) understand the roles and responsibilities of traders, segregation of duties and the processes within Commercial Support functions such as Credit, Tax, Legal, Operations, Logistics, etc.

The government takes both and gives you milk.
Fascism - You have two cows.
The government takes them both and sells you the milk.
Capitalism - You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Bureaucracy - You have two cows.
The government takes them both, shoots one,  milks the other, pays you for the milk , then pours it down the drain.
Corporate - You have two cows.
You downsize one, then require the other one to produce the milk of four cows, then act surprised when it falls dead.
Democracy - You have two cows.
You are taxed to the point where you have to sell them both so that the government can support a man in a foreign country who has one cow, which was a gift from your country.
Hope you enjoyed.

315,"Mike & Sally,  Below is the information that we received on the project.
I am still waiting on a cost center from EES for the expense portions to settle to.
Look over this information and let me know if you still want to meet to go over this.
This is the EES project, which is set up on EES to capture the capital portion of the project costs.
The expense portion should settle to an EES cost center.
The project set up shown below is the Networks project, which I set up, but have not yet released.
Only Release 1 is shown below.
There are three releases set up, but only the first one will be released at this time.
All three releases or phases will look like the other phases.
As you can see below, the capital parts of the project (Solution Definition, Design & Build, and Implementation & Testing) are set up with three basic WBS elements.
These elements as described below will settle to the EES project as follows.
Project Coding on Networks Project					Settles to EES Project WBS C.300000.01.SD.OU	Rel 1 SD Outside Consultants Labor		C.007730.22.01 Outside Professional C.300000.01.SD.EN	Rel 1 SD Enron Labor				C.007730.22.03 Enron Labor C.300000.01.SD.OE	Rel 1 SD Other Expenditures			C.007730.22.05 Other Expenditure  C.300000.01.HW Hardware Purchases					C.007730.24.01 Hardware C.300000.01.SW Software Purchases				            C.007730.24.02 Software  This will allow the costs on the Networks project to be tracked in a manor that will support how the charges are settling to EES.
So if EES has any questions about the charges we should be able to pull up the detail very quickly.
The following items will settle to an EES cost center since they are expense related.

321,"Sally, some thoughts/ideas that I thought about after your meeting.
Lets promote the positive - some very exciting things are happening such as the move to the new building, lets make sure we get the PR out there to talk about the new features, move in plans, etc.
I know security is tight but how about a mini open house.
At this point it would do us good to go beyond the ""Building Guy"".
I know I get excited whenever I'm over there.
Things like vendors in the lobby to push new technology etc.
I believe it's important to keep that almost ""electric"" atmosphere that surrounds the company.
Lets show our employees that our outside business relationships are as strong as ever and our vendors/business partners still view Enron as someone they are eager to continue doing business with.
I always get charged up when the lobby is full of activity.
Keeps the pulse of Enron at a high level.
Get some fun things out there, things the employees can purchase, electronic devices are always attractive.
Work out a decent discount to make it exciting.
Give it a holiday twist.
Even if it costs us a few bucks to make that happen might be worth it.
Make a push to host more industry meetings (GISB is one that I can help with).
Lets get our counterparties in here and let them know nothing has changed.
We can include mini tours of the new building to get the word back on the street about how we might be down but boy are we poised to grow, grow and grow some more.
I mentioned to you that I believe it's important for the Executive team to show up often to reassure our employees that yes there are real, caring people running this company.
Maybe some impromptu floor meetings to talk about recent events.
Let them feel like there is a real connection.
Make it personal and regular.
Thanks for listening, the sense from my group has been okay.
Lots of concerns but nobody running out the door at this point.
I'll keep you posted.

NCL, Inc. at www.nationalcharityleague.org   will be the umbrella site.
Each  chapter that participates will have a web site under this umbrella.
The name will be www.nationalcharityleague/chaptername.org .
The chapters will be given a choice of 4  templates that will allow them to pick colors and graphics that they like.
Each chapter site will contain: 1.
A  front page:  a brief section about  their chapter that can be reached by anyone searching for National Charity  League.
This will be the only  public area.
2.
A  password entry area that will be based on the chapter database or list of  members that they want to have access to their site.
The password entry area will have an  area that members can update their information (change of address, e-mail,  etc.).
3.
The  password protected area will include: a.
A member listing with address, phone numbers, etc.
b.       Philanthropies and schedules for activities c.        Calendar d.       Meeting Schedule (Patroness and Ticktocker) e.        Newsletters f.         Bylaws (searchable by keyword) g.        Ticktocker Procedures (searchable by keyword) h.        Standing Rules (searchable by keyword) i.

The hours chair(s) will be able to ask for and get a report of all hours  submitted.
The individual members  will also be able to get a summary of their hours as well.
j.
And finally, a chat area for chapter members.
The cost:  A  one-time site set-up fee of approximately $500 (this could be slightly more due  to the uncertainty of additional information that chapters may want on their  site) and a $69.95 per month web hosting fee.
I will train the chapter designated person on how to load  their information onto the web area via a manual that I will prepare and at  convention and phone calls.
Our  service provider will handle technical support for non-NCL content related  problems.
Once the templates are  designed and tested, chapter sites could be ready for uploading within 2  weeks.
The template design and  testing will be done over the next several months if there is sufficient  commitment from chapters.
I'll pick  a date of January 1, 2002 for chapter sites to be ready.
It could be sooner but I have to make  sure that there are enough chapters interested before committing my time to this  project.
I can't think of anything else on this subject.

As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here.
We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks.
Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.
NEC Monitors The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.
Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Increased Information Access There are approximately 65 NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 3rd floor.
While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.
The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.
Here's how:  Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.
The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.

We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.
Wireless LAN The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested.
We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.
Amtel Replacement As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging.

With regards to the process, you will continue to utilize the nomination form for Sr.

When ordering future debit cards, we recommend you include denominations of $150 and $200 to handle the additional recognition.
In the interim, when nominating a Manager, you can combine denominations to equal the amount you are interested in rewarding (for example; 1-$100 and 1-$50 card or 2-$100 cards).
We are not suggesting that you award at this amount, however it is available to use at your discretion.
The Enron Reward Bucks maximize at $200, where PBAs generally range from $200-$2000 though with committee approval can range higher.
These programs are intended to compliment each other and we encourage you to utilize them to recognize and reward your team.

Currently, we have approximately $3,000,000 worth of 2002 EDS utilization commitments from various Enron business units.

344,"As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.
To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the ""Operational Risk Committee""), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment.
I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.
Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk.
The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.
It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.
The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.
Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems.
The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.
It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.
A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.
These include: 	 Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.
This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e.
require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e.
a Spreadsheet DPR.
Work with GRMO to develop ""rules of use"" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet ""books"" Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances  Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk Access need for additional or improved risk databases  Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.

345,"Sally / Bill / Shawn  This is a quick note to let you know that as of Monday 1 October Enron Europe will be introducing a robust New Account Opening Policy for all trading counterparties.
The Operational Credit team will be responsible for ensuring the smooth roll-out of the policy and for ensuring compliance with it.
The salient points of the policy are that:  traders will be more accountable for relevant Regulatory and internal compliance concerning their counterparties; money laundering checks will be completed for all new counterparties prior to trading; the Compliance Group will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading; RAC will give sign off for all new counterparties prior to trading.
These controls are already in place for the majority of Enron Europe's counterparties, however, the introduction of the Policy enables us to demonstrate this more effectively to the Regulators and to monitor compliance more easily.
I attach the policy below.
If you have any questions pls give me a call on +44 7783 5261.
Thanks   -   Sam

354,"As you both are aware (not publicly) we are 'right-sizing' again.
This will impact EBS's requirement for services from ENW.
We are finalizing the revised 2002 'look' and it's not pretty.
Confidentially, we will be significantly lower than the 440 we have at present.
As far as I predict right now we'll need the following:  IT Development/Systems  I've met with Inja and asked her to plan for 'minimal maintenance mode' - no development - by 1/1/02.
I've asked her to shoot for no higher than $2m - from $11.2m.
I realize this will involve potential periods of down-time and very thin coverage - unfortunately it's all we can afford.
Inga came back at $1.95m - wihout herself - however, we will need a strong leader - and I've asked her to look at anyway she can stay involved/manage what is going to be a lot of 'no, sorry can't do that' conversations.
This covers upkeep of EnFiber, NETS, EComms, Remedy, PPCS, Fact and all our DB requirements.
IT Infrastructure  I've gave Jenny/Kerry a heads-up of around 300 folks for 2002 a couple of weeks ago - we will be lower.
Our space and IT requirements will be lower accordingly.
We will based out of Houston with a Shepherd warehouse.
No Europe/Asia support can be assumed.
We will also not require EOL.
Let me know what I get for 'not much to spend'.
Energy Ops  Currently at $5m supporting 36 folks.
This will be trimmed to 17 folks.
We will also need a small Contract Admin support level from Pat W's team.
That's a heads-up.
Sorry it's such unpleasent news.

I will let you know as  soon as I know a rescheduled date.
In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with  most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities,  accomplishments and performance.
For those that were unavailable for a  meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to  accomplish the same thing.
I also have any materials that you may have  provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as  copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.
With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of  your resume.

However, it would be helpful to  me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.
Please  e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.

That should make life fun for you!
I wanted to talk about  resources and how I might be able to help in both the further due diligence  efforts and longer term in the assimilation.
As in my voice mail, I believe  that a doorstep review of trading locations would be critical, both from a  controls perspective and from the perspective of an up close view of how they  run their business.
It seems that might help jump start the plans around how  best to assimilate the business.
I had suggested my new hire, Shona Wilson,  as a potential resource and then there are several of us who have already  been involved in doorstep reviews that could be involved both in the US and  in other locations.
Brent has forwarded a memo to me from Naomi Connell  who  seems to be formulating a plan for the doorstep reviews.
I don't know the  names that she mentions (other than Tani Nath), and I am sure that she is  unaware of additional resources from Houston that could be used.
We can  hopefully talk about that tomorrow morning.

466,"While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made  at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.
In  talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University  of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an  internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for  summer 2001 interns.
I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her  manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay  interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's  staffing.
When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the  practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more  concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.
It would  seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern  interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for  Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for  our Analyst and Associates programs.
I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with  no resolution.
When they could not provide the competitive data to either  confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a   Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.
Lexi and Shelley  either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do  so.
They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this  critical information.
I now have information at hand with regard to firms  that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring  top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for  these positions this fall.
While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits,  I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all  campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.
As administrators of the  program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to  carry the Enron message to campus.
I believe that we also have an obligation  to make this a two-way messaging system.
I strongly believe that we must  address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on  campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.
I  suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of  the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer  internships.
In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive  sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the  decision on interviewing summer interns.
I have copied both of them on this  note to the two of you.
Please let me know how this can be resolved.
With the help of James Scribner  and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that  should be targeted for summer internships.
I will offer as much of my time  as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative  ways to turn this around.

509,"Today was the final ENA PRC.
Relative ranking results up through the Senior  Director level are final.
You and your management team can begin the process  of giving performance reviews to your employees.
I spoke with Sheila Walton  today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting  the employee reviews.
She indicated that the target completion date should  be the end of July.
Promotions will be effective August 1st.
It is Dave Delainey's intent to  announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.
I do not  yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single  memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.
I will keep you  updated on this as I get direction from him.
Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.
In  order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review  process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when  conducting their reviews.
It is very important for all of us to be  consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups  who will be giving performance reviews.
It is important to note, however,  that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view  of that employee's relative ranking.
In other words, an employee in the  Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that  the employee is doing a great job.
Clearly, a large number of employees  performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory  category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas  of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in  the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.
Also please note the following:   Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or  Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given  to the employees.
This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with  the relative performance of that employee.
(This has been the stated process  for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process  as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team,  yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced  members of your management team, or those management team members where you  have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and  perhaps tough performance feedback.
I believe that we have spent some time  in identifying these situations.
I ask your help to ensure that we follow  through on this commitment.
Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a  meaningful one.

Does he  have a strong background in trading operations?
Will he be  able to  coordinate effective reviews from a controls perspective, and will he be able  to be the front-runner on how MG runs its business so that we will get a jump  start on how best to assimilate the business?
I think that this effort  should be much broader than deal testing.
It should encompass assessing  people, processes, controls, systems support, etc.
To do this quickly and  effectively will require persons who are knowledgeable about daily trading  operations.
I don't know Naomi's background, but I wonder if she will be  the right person to lead one of these efforts since she does not work in  operations on a daily basis.

542,"Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.
Since  Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him  in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain  a mention of the transition:  Example:   Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.
He will be  transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce  assumes his responsibilities for EBS.
The current trading staff for EBS will  report to Barry effective with his start date in May.
I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out  of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading  operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.
So sounds as if that  is clarified.
",Announcement on Barry Pearce's role
543,"Charlene:  Outlined below are the points I promised to send you before our  meeting on Wednesday morning.
I don't know your agenda for the meeting, so  it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow.
Background:  As a long-time supporter of the analyst program, I became  concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other  supporters of the program.
Many of those expressing frustration are heavily  involved in the recruiting process.
It is their commitment to both  recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting  talented candidates to what has been the Merchant Services Analyst Program.
I initiated a meeting, announced at Rick Causey's staff meeting, that would  bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss  them with you in a constructive manner.
Our intent is continued support and  improvement of the program.
The meeting took place on March 28 and included  the following:   Brenda Herod   ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - LSU   Brent Price  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT     Jeff Sommers  CALME    Executive Lead - Univsersity of Florida   Ed Coats  Corp. Tax    Core Team Member - UT, A&M, LSU and University of  Florida   Sally Beck  ENA - Energy Operations Executive Lead - UT and OU   Carolyn Barrett  EBS       Howard Selzer  Enron Global E&P    Summary of Concerns and Discussion Points:  One program, or two:  Prior to campus recruiting in the fall 1999, an  announcement  was made that there would be one analyst program.
Not much  materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be  managed.
In fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw  that the MSAP and the Commercial Anlayst programs were managed separately and  differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation.
We  feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program  on campus.
SIngle start date:  The single start date of July 17 for analysts is  impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an  innovative company.
The July start date does not consider December graduates  and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in  May.
Lack of communication:   We are some of the most involved and committed  senior managers in the MSAP, and yet we have received little information or  communication about the program.
We hear rumors of ""tracks"", but no facts  or details.
Some of us had heard about the single July start date, and some  had not.
Commercial focus too heavy:  Presentation materials, the attitudes of support  staff in the Associates/Analysts Program and interview processes are heavily  focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs.
Lack of input from biggest supporters:  Given the time and effort that many  of us put into the MSAP, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join  with you in some of your plans for the program.
We are concerned that  decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum  without what could be some valuable input from some of us.
MSAP has taken a step backward:  Previously, with a dedicated leadership team  and staff, the MSAP had made great strides in the consistency of our on  campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top  candidates and the pride of participants in the program.
We feel that the  focus on the MSAP has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and  we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program.

548,"Energy Operations has two sets of season tickets for Astros games this  season.
One set is four tickets in the field box level, and the other set is  two tickets in the terrace level.
I have also purchased one parking spot in  a lot that is a couple of blocks from the stadium.
I have divided the  tickets among you, with my husband's help.
He identified ""good games"" (i.e.
teams that everyone likes to see), and those are distributed equally across  my direct reports.
Tickets for the other games have been distributed based  your percentage of Energy Operations employees.
For most games, you will  receive all six tickets.
You can use these tickets for yourself and for a  small reward for a job well done by someone in your group.
The parking  information will accompany the group of four field box tickets.
Patti is  including a map of downtown with the parking lot pinpointed.
Your tickets  will be distributed to you this week.
I hope that you and your staff will  enjoy these.
I also received over 100 tickets from Cliff Baxter, Greg Whalley and Dave  Delainey for the exhibition game on Saturday, April 1.
I have chosen to  distribute two tickets a piece to all directors and managers in Energy  Operations who are not my direct reports.
SInce you will have first call on  the season tickets going to your group, I thought that it would be nice to  make these tickets available to the next tier of leadership.
I wanted to  make you aware of this before these are distributed tomorrow.
Finally, I have purchased a block of tickets for two upcoming games, one a  weekday afternoon and one a weekend.

",Energy Operations PRC Meetings
552,"Brent Price and I will be in the London office next week, arriving Monday  morning and returning to Houston on Friday.
The purpose of my visit is in  regard to my Global Risk Management Operations role,   I believe that Rick  Causey met with you regarding some operations support that Brent and I will  provide to Fernley during a transition period prior to the arrival and during  the assimilation of Michael Jordan, the JP Morgan staffer that Fernley has  hired.
Brent and I will be working with Fernley next week to iron out the  details of our support for Fernley during that transition period.
We will  also map out an Enron trading operations introduction  for Michael Jordan,  which may involve a short stint for him in Houston.
My goal is to provide a  strong resource to Fernley during this transition period and to work with  Fernley to provide whatever assistance, training, and orientation to Michael  in his role so that his assimilation can be as smooth and effective as  possible.
Another purpose for the trip is to spend some time with Fernley and his   business controllers  to get their ideas on specific goals that as a group we  would commit to for 2000.
I know that Barry and Richard Sage have many good  ideas on how we can leverage knowledge and best practices across all Enron  locations with trading operations.
My earlier trips to London this year were  focused solely on Helsinki, and did not allow time to positively focus on  leveraging worldwide operations experience.
I value input from other trading  operations professionals and I look forward to the ideas that can be  generated in working with Barry, Richard and some of their direct reports.
I also contacted Tani Nath about my trip to see how I could support her as  she moves into her role in Global Products.
I have not heard  from Tani, but  I understand from others that she will be in the Houston office next week.
It will be unfortunate to miss her on my trip, but based on my commitments in  Houston and Rick Causey's desire to move forward on providing trading  operations support to Fernley, next week is the best for me to be in London.
I did meet with Tani for an hour when she was here week before last and  offered to help her in any way if she made the decision to accept the role  over Global Products.
I trust that she will contact me for that support as  needed.
I have scheduled a short meeting one on one with you while I am there to  discuss how my global role can provide support and resources for your  business efforts in London.
I look forward to meeting with you next week.
This trip is not a leg of the worldwide operations/control review that we are  conducting at Joe Sutton's request.
By circumstance, as you know, we have  taken a look at Helsinki and subsequently Oslo and Frankfurt.
There will be  a similar review of Continental power, UK gas, UK power and global liquids.
The review teams are currently focused on operations/controls reviews of  North American locations and some entities in the US in which Enron has a  large ownership position.
It is likely that the continuation of this effort  in London will occur in mid April.
Copies of the drafts of the findings for Oslo and Frankfurt were provided to  Fernley as soon as the team returned to Houston.
We hope to finalise those  drafts this week as we receive comments from Fernley and the business  managers in Oslo and Frankfurt to whom those drafts were provided.
Fernley  suggested that you would like to see the drafts as opposed to the final  copies, so I will have those forwarded to you today.
The Sydney and  Singapore trip was a lengthy one, as it also involved a last leg of the trip  in London with regard to support for SIngapore.
The Houston team returned  the middle of last week and worked with AA on an early draft last Friday.
I  can also provide you with a draft of that report, the completion of which was  pending input from Bill Bradford early this week (he made the trip but was  out of the office last week).
We did do a preliminary review of the Sydney  and Singapore findings with Rick Causey and Rick Buy on Friday afternoon, to  accommodate the fact that both are out on vacation this week.
They  understood the preliminary nature of the draft that was reviewed with them.

My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I  trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.
I will look forward  to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide,  with effective exception reporting.
This is a key initiative for 2000 and  will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities.

555,"Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might  interest you.
The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just  accepted a job offer from me.
James and I worked together previously at a  bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.
When I asked if  he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that  we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.
His read is that she is very  bright, creative, and innovative.
She has worked on many special projects at  Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist  role as she learned Enron and would then ""earn"" her way into managing special  projects.
I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.

I can leave a voice mail for you at  your Enron number.
Or if you prefer, I would be happy to call you if you  will provide me with a number where you will be.
Cliff Baxter and several  key commercial personnel have asked that I call them after we have completed  our testing of all systems that support each commodity and product that we  trade in North America.
I will make these phone calls myself, and will  naturally treat all phone numbers that I have been given as confidential.
Please let me know your preference for notification.
2)  Definition of a global focus for trading operations:  Attached is a draft  memo that Rick Causey proposes to send.
This memo describes a coordination  role that I will play on certain operational policies and procedures that  should be coordinated in all trading locations.
Please let me and/or Rick  know if you have any comments or suggestions.
I had hoped to briefly discuss  this with you in person, as I would want you to understand two points:  (1)  This role will not prevent me from continuing a very strong focus on the  needs of ENA.
I have worked very hard to assure a level of accuracy, control  and service in ENA operations.
Through that hard work, I believe that I have  your confidence in my ability to deliver results.
I  would do nothing to  jeopardize that.
(2)  There is a need for this coordination function, and  some one will play that role.
If I play that role, I can be in the best  position to influence outcomes with ENA's needs in mind.
3)   Gas Logistics:  I will talk with Whalley about my thoughts on this, but  I had wanted to make you aware that Jeff Shankman believes that he wants  logistics to report to him.
His stated reason to me is that he wants it to  ""look like power"".
I had wanted to discuss with you your thoughts on what   the criteria should be on which we make that decision.
I will propose to  Greg and Jeff that gas logistics should be located in direct proximity to the  regional traders in order to facilitate the flow of commercially viable  information about the pipes and capacity.
( We have that now for the Central  and West desks, and should be able to make this happen as the 32nd floor is  built out for gas.)
I believe, however, that gas logistics should now report  to Brent Price, my business controller over gas for the East, Central and  West regions.
Brent would then have operations truly front to back (risk,  confirmations, scheduling and invoicing) and he sits on 31 and works very  closely with Jeff.
Also, Brent would be in the best position to ensure that  the logistics team meets requirements for timeliness and accuracy of  volumetric information so that we can achieve our target headcount reduction  in gas operations of 52 by year end 2000.
Without a continuing focus in  logistics on the downstream information needs, I will be concerned about our  ability to deliver our projected cost savings.
I also believe that Brent  will be in the best position to ensure minimal flash to actual variances.
While Greg and Jeff were certainly both with ECT in 1996 when we had an  earnings hit as a result of flash to actual variances, I am not sure that  either one was involved closely enough to appreciate the need for a strong  front to back focus to prevent these problems, and that includes holding  logistics accountable for their part in this.
I will let you know the outcome of my conversations with Greg and Jeff on  this issue.
",Various Discussion Points
582,"We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th  floor.
Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to  densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property  Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.
In the mean  time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the  capacity on the floor.
While these locations are not prime spots, people  will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.
Once the window  seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign  groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.
I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while  she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations  personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.
Susan Harrison is  working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition  period.
Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and  equipment on the 30th floor.
If there are any problems once a move has  occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment,  printers, etc.
), please contact Chantelle at Ext.
3-6279 as she will also  coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.
If Chantelle is not  available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.
Maria can be reached at Ext.
3-5586.
I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the  window spaces.
We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and  supplies on the floor.
Please coordinate with your assistant to have your  area cleaned up by December 31.
During this clean-up process, if you have  any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn  Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext.
3-5237 and she  will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.
Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a  neat and professional work environment.
Between now and the summer of 2001  when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are  all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.
I would greatly  appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available  space effectively.

583,"FYI:  Effective today, the schedulers for HPL have relocated from the 42nd floor to  the 30th floor.
This team reports to my direct report, Brenda Herod, who is  the Business Controller for the Asset Group and Texas trading region.
They  are on the west side of the building, just outside my office.
While room for  this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made  to improve communications with the Texas desk traders.
By being within the  same elevator bank, we can now employ ""squawk"" boxes between the traders and  this scheduling team.
As we look at space usage on the 32nd floor, this team  should be included in space requirements.
We are working with Liz Taylor on  those requirements.

Saying it is busy here sounds a bit like a broken record, but  it is busy here!
Big challege currently is juggling our huge day-to-day  business for Enron Americas, starting the absorption of some pieces of EES  (my part alone looks like an additional 120 employees, with the intent to  find ways to assimilate that business and ultimately reduce overall support  costs for Enron), the sale of Houston Pipeline to AEP that should conclude in  June or July and the commercialization of mid and back office services.

591,"Mary Solmonson has made a personal choice to resign from Enron.
It is with  regret that I have accepted Mary's letter of recommendation.
Mary has  contributed greatly during her tenure at Enron, particularly in the  development of global information that has been critical in supporting our  effective systems development and information gathering.
I do appreciate  Mary's personal decision, however, and I know that you will join me in  wishing Mary well.
Also effective April 16, we have made a realignment within Enron Net Works of  the group led by Sheri Thomas.
Sheri will now report directly to Andy  Zipper, who leads EnronOnline.
The Operations Product Control Team in its  early stages was focused primarily on making our transition to EnronOnline a  smooth one for operations.
Much time was spent initially on the bridges  necessary between EnronOnline and our legacy systems.
The role of the team  has evolved today to one that is intimately involved in the day-to-day   operations of EnronOnline.
With this evolution, it makes sense to have  Sheri's team as an integral part of the larger EnronOnline team.
Sheri's  team will continue to support other e-commerce initiatives, such as  Clickpaper, DealBench and CommodityLogic, so that we can leverage the  experience of her team and avoid duplication of internal infrastructure.
Sheri, Andy and I met with Sheri's team yesterday to announce this  organizational realignment.
Sheri has done a great job of leading the  Product Control Group over the past 14 months.
Sheri is committed to see  that her team continues to work closely with Operations to ensure that any  changes in Enron's e-commerce businesses that may impact trading operations  are shared with us.
We look forward to continuing to work closely with Sheri  and her team.

Thanks to Patti, who scoped out  options for new tickets, and to my husband, who studied advantages and  disadvantages of each option, we  have some good seats for the year.
The new  tickets (4 together) are Dugout tickets, located between home and third base,  about 28 rows up from the field.
Not aisle tickets this year, but I sat in  the seats for the pre-season opener, and they are a big improvement over last  year!
We will work on the aisle for next  year.
We also still have the two  Terrace level tickets as we did last year.

598,"Your recent voice mail message to me indicated that you maintain a list of  board positions held by VP's and above.
I thought that it might be helpful  to have this in writing to add to your list.
Beginning with a fiscal year  that starts April 2001, I am now a member of the Board and President-Elect of  National Charity League, a mother-daughter community volunteer organization.
We have over 300 members, including mothers and their daughters in grades 7  through 12, in the Spring/Champions area.
We run bingo games in local  nursing homes, provide ""coaching"" during practices for Special Olympics  volleyball, tennis, track and bowling, stock local food pantries, work with  children in after-school programs in the local elementary schools, etc.
It  is a great way to create common goals for mother and daughter teams with a  focus on others, at a time when girls would otherwise tend to be focused only  on themselves.
The hope is that this early introduction to volunteerism will  remain with the girls as a lifelong commitment.

599,"I won't bury you with constant examples, but am copying you on this note  regarding floor meetings.
While operations is now a part of Enron Net Works,  I believe that the only meaningful piece of that to Philippe and Greg is our  commercialization effort.
They are not in the habit of considering the 500  people who provide critical services to EA, EGM and EIM daily.
Floor  meetings set by Greg and Philippe were apparently aimed at the IT teams, and  yet my group has added over 500 employees to Net Works in Houston alone with  our reorganization late last fall.
I will diligently work with Philippe and  Greg on this on an on-going basis.
While not fully embraced as part of Net  Works, my operations team now is organizationally separated from the key  Enron businesses that we support.

612,"I talked with Anne Koehler in Legal today to determine her understanding of  what is required from Energy Operations prior to the effective sale of HPL.
Anne believes that she may have been the one to introduce the term ""protocol""  into these discussions.
To clarify, according to Anne, the ""protocol"" is not  anticipated to be a formal legal document.
Instead, Anne envisions simply  e:mails or memos between Enron and AEP with regard to any sharing of  information, agreements on processes to be followed in the transition, etc.
Operational details to be decided between Enron and AEP have been handled  exactly in that manner to date, with e:mails being sent from Bob Ball (Enron)  to Steve Jackson (AEP).
Only critical changes to the Purchase and Sale Agreement will be formally  documented.
Bob Hall identified the treatment of cash accounts in the  original Purchase and Sale Agreement as incorrect relative to cash flows for  gas to be delivered in the month of May.
He has worked with Enron's treasury  group to establish the correct procedures and has worked with Sandi Braband  in Legal to document this change to the Purchase and Sale Agreement as an  Amendment to that agreement.
As of today, Legal has completed revisions to  that amendment and Anne Koehler is sending it to Mary Perkins in Enron's  Treasury group for her review.
Upon Mary's review, Anne will forward the  amendment to AEP for their review before final signatures.
We devised this week a new format for incorporating the AEP-HPL transition  issues on which my team has been focused and have provided that to both of  you.
This new format incorporates the various memos and e:mails which have  to date captured the status of transition issues.
Items that only require  actions by Enron will be our ""to do"" list.
Each item has a due date and we  will update you weekly on progress.
Those items that fall under the AEP list  or which appear in both the Enron and AEP list will be the items to which we  will evidence communication to AEP and/or their agreement via the e:mails or  memos as suggested by Ann Koehler.
I believe that this should satisfy your  requests earlier this week for written ""protocol"".
We will also update you  weekly on the status of those e:mails and/or memos between ourselves and  AEP.
I understand that the two of you have a regular weekly meeting for an update  on the HPL sale.
To provide clarity for these update meetings, may I suggest  that we incorporate one of the following two approaches:    1)  Brian and I hold a regular meeting just prior to your update meeting so  that Brian has a full   understanding of operational transition items and  their status, or    2) I attend the first part of your update meeting in order to provide a  firsthand update to the two of you.

613,"In a recent CommodityLogic staff meeting, I took stock of the number of  people and projects that I have provided from Energy Operations to that  team.
From conversations that you and I have had, I get the impression that  perhaps others have led you to believe that my commitment to CommodityLogic  has been limited.
The truth is that I hand picked key members of the team  and transferred projects that we were already undertaking in Energy  Operations to round out the suite of products to be offered through  CommodityLogic.
I just thought that it might be helpful for you to have the  facts so that you are fully informed whenever you are involved in  conversations around CommodityLogic.

Both had worked  in managerial roles in our natural gas business, reporting to Brent Price.
Both had been significantly challenged in the first half of 2000 by roles  where they were charged with managing large teams of people.
But knowing  both Carrie and Susan well, I viewed them as valuable members of the  operations team who know a lot about the business.

Commercialization Efforts- Services:  Delayed by several days due to the  unexpected absence of Mary Solmonson for health reasons.
I learned about  this when I returned to the office on Tuesday, and have worked to replace her  as best we can during this market sizing phase.
Jennifer Denney (who was in  Dallas with us and works under Sheri Thomas in the EOL Product Control Group)  will partner with James Scribner in Mary's absence to help us run down  additional data on potential customers.
Beth Apollo will be working closely  with James and Jennifer.
They will welcome Rahil's help and will continue to  work with Jennifer on developing the revenue model.
Commercialization Efforts - Consulting:  Bjorn Hagelman in the RAC group made  a presentation at the Risk Forum luncheon last week outlining a plan for  providing risk consulting services to external customers.
Some of his ideas  overlap the ideas around consulting that we fleshed out in our Dallas  meeting.
Some of his ideas included providing services from my risk  operations team.
I want this to be a concerted and not disjointed effort.
Bjorn's vision is to create an Enron sub that will be the consulting  company.
Our team in Dallas saw wisdom in partnering with an  accounting/consulting firm - established marketing arm, existing customer  contacts, proven consulting skills, depth of resources, etc.
There could be  a play to get a hefty sum up front from a consulting firm to partner with us  - we impart our risk knowledge, they get the edge in the marketplace from  pairing with us, we take our upfront payment, they do most of the grinding  work - not necessarily a bad model.
Bjorn seems to be in a hurry, as he has  identified a shipping company in Europe that is in need of risk consulting  and is ready to pay.
Probably okay for him to start this effort in that  way.
Prove concept, and then we can consider the wisdom of partnering with  someone else.
I spent some time with him today.
I want to be sure that he  doesn't commit my team to provide a service without our understanding and  being in agreement with the fee structure.
We are okay for right now.
I  will be following what Bjorn is doing and looking for ways to work together  if there is a good upside.
I will keep you posted.
Commercialization Efforts - Internal Marketing:  We have to change some  business practices within Enron and create a mind shift when originators are  selling operational services to their customers.
We must price those and we  must have a mechanism for granting the appropriate income to Operations.
Deal is in the works through power origination team - they priced our  services to customer without our involvement- pricing may not even be  sufficient to cover our costs.
We are researching.
To do's here are to  create an internal marketing document to review with lead originators and to  change DASH process so that Operations has a sign-off.
I met with Louise  today on this.
I will plan meetings with origination teams during the week  of March 19.
Would love to get your input on our presentation to the orig  teams.
I will get you a draft for your comments.
Operational Risk:  Key focus this week has been on rebuilding a risk team in  Portland.
Have worked with Stacey White (my power risk director) and Tim  Belden to make sure we have a short term and long term plan that will work.
I am comfortable that we have devised a good plan.
(We lost the manager of  that group last week - a planned move to London to follow her husband to an  Enron job there.
Our unexpected change this week was the resignation Monday  of another risk book administrator from Portland.)
Operational Risk:  Another key area that we are focusing on is the HPL sale.
End of day today we will know which employees are going to AEP.
We are  working on a smooth transition plan and how we will handle trailing issues  with customers after the sale effective date.
We expect to eliminate 46  positions with the sale.
This number was much larger earlier in the year  (around 70), but have had a lot of attrition with the news of the sale.
Bob  Hall is focused on the details around this issue.
Operational Risk:  We completed a Doorstep Review on the Monterrey office  last week.
(This is the review of operational controls and procedures.)
Went well - Max was skeptical about the process at first, but pleased in the  end.
I will forward and e:mail to you from Max proclaiming his support of  these reviews.
We overhauled this week the Doorstep Review schedule for the  remainder of the year and reviewed that today with Rick Causey.
He likes the  revisions that we have made.
Beth Apollo on my team is leading this effort.
Spring Break Plans:  My children are on Spring Break the week of March 12 and  the nanny has the week off.
We will be out of town through Wednesday, March  13 with the whole family looking at colleges for Meagan.
Patti has contact  numbers for me if needed.
I may decide to come back into the office on  Thursday and Friday.

623,"We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very  fruitful trip for the team.
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.
Klein is  super-sized.
The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy  in the super category.
Best in Category awards are given for each category  of team dance entered, regardless of school size.
Klein won best in category  for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean  sweep.
Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first  place in the duet category.
Also won first place in officer dances for super  sized schools.
They also won two special judges awards - not given out every  time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on  both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the  choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100  awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed  like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).
The girls were pretty  excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.
They all work so hard and  spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!
I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines  sometime.
I had a lot of fun.
The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of  the moms who were chaperoning as well.

As of last week, we have redirected Shona's reporting line to Beth Apollo.
I  have asked Beth to review the doorstep review plan for all of 2001 and to  recommend any changes in timing and approach.
Beth is in fact in Monterrey,  Mexico today and tomorrow, completing a review of that office.
Soon after  she returns, she will review and update the suggested doorstep review  schedule.
After that has been updated, she will review the revised schedule  with Rick Causey for any additional input and concurrence on the selection of  key offices/businesses to review and the timing of such.

627,"I have a stretch goal for the operations budget under Enron Americas to  reduce costs by the end of the year.
To this end, I have recently studied  possible options for reaching the targeted savings.
To make the best  decision on this, I have reviewed functions within my team on the basis of  core versus non-core functions, and the inherent cost versus value  proposition.
As a result, I made the decision last week to disband Joel Henenberg's team.
To fulfill the role of Joel and his team in leading IT initiatives, we will  lean on the appropriate IT project managers and the business sponsors/end  users.
Joel and his team were told of this decision on Friday afternoon last week.

633,"Doorstep reviews are by design a quick look at commercial activities and the  mid and back office support for those activities in our wholesale  businesses.
(EBS and EES will be included in 2001.)
The controls around  mid and back office activities are best understood by conducting a deal test  - i.e.
following the process and documentation around a series of  transactions from the inception of a deal through the collection of cash.
Asking someone to explain their processes and controls is more the act of  explaining what we think happens.
Doing a deal test tells us what does  happen.
And it is when there are differences between the controls that we  believe to be in place and what actually happens, that we identify where  operational, and perhaps financial, risk is created.
These reviews are not designed to replace the internal audit work for which  Enron has contracted with Arthur Andersen.
As such, they are purposely  designed to be conducted in a shorter timeframe than AA's reviews and to  produce less paperwork.
It is both the quick assessment of control gaps and  potential operational risk, and the quick solutions to correct these, that  are valuable in these reviews.
These reviews also look  for ways to leverage  success stories from one office to another in terms of best in class  practices or practical solutions to shared problems.
Briefly, the doorstep  review process would follow this set of steps:   1)  Cross-functional doorstep review team arrives at subject office.
This  is usually unannounced, but key personnel in the subject office may be  notified of the review a few days prior to the team's arrival to be certain  that key individuals in that office will be not be out of town.
2)  Doorstep team lead will meet with the head of the subject office to tell  them about the parameters of the review and to ask their co-operation in  making information and personnel available to complete the review.
3)  The review is conducted, including information sessions with key  commercial personnel to understand the business conducted in the office and  key control/operations personnel to understand the business processes.
The  deal test is conducted on a relevant sample of deals to verify the process  and controls that were followed in the life of the transactions.
4)  The doorstep team usually has a rough draft of key points by the end of  the review, which includes both controls that are working well and those  which may not be working as designed.
Potential action items are suggested.
This information is reviewed with the head of the office, as they are usually  very interested in knowing what can be done to improve controls to support  their business.
There are times when the head of an office will suggest an  additional point to be added to the list of action items, knowing that with  this focus he/she can get help in accomplishing certain efforts to support  the growth of their business.
The doorstep team lets the head of the office  know to whom this information will be communicated and the timing for doing  so.
5)  Starting late in 2000, the findings from doorstep reviews would next be  reviewed with Ted Murphy and me.
Ted's viewpoint would be from Risk Controls  and mine from the mid and back office operations point of view.
Ted and I,  assisted by Cassandra Schultz and Shona Wilson, would work with appropriate  personnel in the subject offices to understand who would assume  responsibility for addressing action items noted from the doorstep review and  to determine the appropriate time period for completing these action items.
Then on a quarterly basis, Ted and I would meet with Rick Buy and Rick Causey  to give them a recap of doorstep reviews completed during that quarter,  doorstep findings that had been handled, updates on any outstanding doorstep  findings and plans for the next quarter.
Through most of 2000, the doorstep  teams met with Rick and Rick within a few days of returning from each  doorstep review.
This immediate feedback step was passed to Ted and me  sometime late in 2000.
We did agree that we would meet with Rick and Rick  before the quarterly review if certain doorstep findings were of particular  concern or if we felt that they needed to be informed on an issue in a more  timely manner than quarterly.
Steps 1 through 4 were followed in the review of the scrap metals business in  Germany.
Shona did conduct a debriefing session with the managing directors  in charge of the scrap metal business.
Her impression was that they were not  concerned over the length of time that it was taking to implement the  integration plan nor over the somewhat irregular payment methods that were  discovered during the deal test that are not in keeping with Enron's  practices.
Shona also debriefed with Mike Jordan, and I believe that Fernley  was involved in that session as well.
At my suggestion, she also contacted  Joe Gold to inform him of her findings.
I do not know what the timing was  for Joe to get back to Shona, relative to Rick Buy's e:mail message.
Michael, I understand that you may have felt blind-sided by the e:mail from  Rick Buy on his concerns over the scrap metal business.
And if that was the  case, I apologize for that.
While Shona did debrief with Mike and Fernley, I  know that she did not review the teams findings directly with you.
If you  would like to be included in a direct debriefing with the doorstep team when  they review businesses that are managed by EEL, we can certainly add that as  a clear step from this point going forward.
The out of the ordinary step in  this doorstep review was Shona's call to Rick Buy and Rick Causey to alert  them to the doorstep team's concerns over irregular payment methods and the  level of interest in controls that she perceived from the commercial managing  directors.
I attribute that to a miscommunication between Shona and  myself.
Although we had changed the process at year end so that the  download after doorstep was to be with Ted and me, as Shona and I voice  mailed back and forth she thought that I had asked that she initiate a  meeting with Rick and Rick.
This meeting should have been with Ted and me.
In leaving a voice mail for the two Rick's about setting up a meeting, Shona  mentioned some concerns.
Rick Buy is the one that called her back and asked  for more detail.
She definitely covered both the teams findings and the  integration plan that was underway with Rick Buy.
We don't, however, control  which points Rick chooses to focus on or those to which he chooses to react.
To reiterate, the findings from these doorstep reviews are shared with the  heads of the subject offices at the close of the reviews.
The effort here is  to help identify control issues that could create risk to a business and to  offer solutions and resources that may be available from across the entire  Enron organization.
The key is quick discovery and quick resolution.
The  findings create a dialogue between the business units, RAC and Operations,  which I believe is healthy.
We purposefully have chosen not to  ""over-wordsmith"" the findings or to delay discussing concerns that can be  surfaced through these reviews.
Frankly, I believe that these reviews can  reveal things that are sometimes missed in AA's reviews from a practical  perspective and afford us the opportunity to mitigate operational risk.
I would be glad to discuss any details of the doorstep review process with  you.
We certainly want you to be informed and to view this process as  valuable input for you in managing EEL's business.
Mike Jordan and certain  members of his team will be involved with doorstep reviews for other  businesses outside EEL later in the year.
We are certainly open to any  suggestions you may have on getting the most out of this process.

641,"Along with Mike McConnell, I am active in recruiting for Enron's Analyst  Program at the University of Oklahoma.
We became involved in recruiting  there two years ago when I learned about a targeted undergraduate program  that seemed like it could be a good fit for our program.
OU transformed  their old PLM (Petroleum Land Management) program into the Energy Management  Program in the School of Business.
This undergraduate degree retains the  geology, business law and other specialized classes that were part of the PLM  program, but adds additional finance hours with a focus on derivatives and a  trading floor course.
With the added plus of many of these students growing  up in or around ""energy"" families in Oklahoma or Texas, I thought that  recruiting top graduates from this program could be beneficial to Enron.
Our  recruiting efforts at OU continue to be successful and our OU Energy  Management graduates have done well at Enron.
Our first hire from OU (and the top Energy Management student) was Jody  Crook.
He joined the analyst program last February after a December 1999  graduation.
His first rotation has been on my team, working as a risk book  administrator in gas trading.
He is in the process of looking for a second  rotation at the end of February, and I think that he is someone that you  should consider for a rotation on your team.
In addition to this last year's  risk experience at Enron, Jody worked as a landman for two summers for  Burlington Resources.
I was very involved in recruiting Jody to Enron.
I think very highly of him,  and want to be sure that he has good rotations while in the Analyst program.

680,"Hi all!
Attached is a breif outline on the NJ Basic Generation Service Standard Offer.
- Please read.
Although this will have risks regarding capacity, ancillary services, and basis; This may be an excellent means to test the PJM standard offer market, since the minimum size required would be a 100MW slice.
The NJ Board of Public Utiltiy is currently shaping the auction process, and our regulatory people have been involved by interventions.
Jeff Ader (EES) has been working with regulatory to push that this should be a retail deal (similar to the retail customers that New Power won from PECO) and not a wholesale deal.
Is this the message we want to send?
I suggested to regulatory that we propose that it should be split as to allow the best pricing for the NJ utilities and for everyone to be able to participate.
They suggested that if EES has more interest than EWS (apparently they wish to take 1000MW of this), that we should push the retail.
How would retail take the ancillary and capacity risk?
Are we set up such that EES would have a better chance of winning this?
What is our interest in taking on these exposures?
Can we meet later today, or tomorrow (Friday) to determine at least, how we want regulatory to proceed with the BPU.
Nick, Palmer and I had a conference call with regulatory yesterday, and want to get back to them as they will be filing with the BPU very shortly.

2) Purchase a collar (potentially zero cost) whereby the cap price will be $15 above the underlying and the floor is approx.

685,"The U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, DC Circuit, issued a ruling today on the EPA Section 126 Rule.
(As brief background, the 126 Rule would have required compliance with more stringent summer-season NOx caps starting in May 2003 in several northeast and Midwest states)  The Order states:    ""It is Ordered that EPA's Section 126 Rule is remanded as to all cogenerators, but vacated only as to those cogenerators classified as electric generating units (""EGUs"") under the rule that supply equal to or less than one third of their potential capacity or equal to or less than 25 MW to the grid for sale per year.""
Translation:  This part of the order appears to ""vacate"" or completely throw out the 126 rule for small cogen units (under 25 MW) or cogen units selling less than 1/3 into the grid.
For all other cogenerators, the court remands the rule to EPA for re-working, consistent with some of the court's earlier objections about EPA's handling of cogens.
Impact:  EPA will need to go back and formulate rules for cogens altogether, so there is currently no NOx compliance schedule in place for cogen units.
EPA will need to start from scratch for smaller cogens.
""It is Further ordered that as of May 15, 2001, the date of this court's decision, the three-year compliance period for emissions limitations applicable to EGUs under the Section 126 Rule is tolled, pending EPA's resolution of the remand of EGU growth factors ordered by this court.""
Translation:  This more significant part of the order ""tolls"" -- or puts on hold -- compliance with the 126 Rule for ALL ELECTRIC GENERATING UNITS (EGUs) until EPA resolves EGU growth factor issues that the court identified in its May 15, 2001 ruling.

If a new entity purchases the Enron trading business and the contingent employment agreement executed on January 5, 2002 becomes a valid and binding agreement, Enron's management will not initiate a lawsuit to recover the 2001 performance bonus payments.
Enron and/or purchaser of the Enron trading business will seek approval from the bankruptcy judge of the 2001 performance bonus payments to eliminate any future uncertainty with respect to the validity of those payments.
To the extent the total retention $'s available for the Enron trading business employees is increased above current levels (from the leading bidder as of January 5, 2002), the intent of Enron's senior management is to make an upward adjustment to the individual employees who have committed to the new entity such that the employee maintains a substantially similar percentage of the total ""pool"" of retention $'s.

698,"Kevin:  Rob Benson called me this morning to ask about the process for Permanent Residency (Green Card).
At this time, I have been asked to hold on all new Green Card applications until further notice.
However, we might want to amend Rob's visa status from L1B to L1A, making it easier, faster and cheaper to process the Green Card, hopefully in the near future.
Rob was originally brought into the US in the capacity of Associate and this is why we used the L1B visa and not the L1A at that time.
Now that he is a Director, we should be able to amend his visa to L1A.
(The L1A is usually for Managers or above, or someone managing a function).
Do I have your authority to go ahead with the amendment?
The approximate cost is $1,000.

704,"The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.
Stack Manager Modifications  Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button.
Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products.
Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable.
See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right.
Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.
Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack.
In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"".
The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader.
In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.
Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank.
On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics.
Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.
No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager.
If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"".
Changes regarding Suspension of products  Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:  ?
Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending.
In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?
Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached.
This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section.
?
Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

I have sorted the information by POI #, BTU content, carbon dioxide content, helium content, C6+ content and nitrogen content.
The POI listing is consistent with the official Bushton Universe list used for Gas Logistics purposes with the following exceptions:  	1.
POIs # 71315 and # 71316 are not on the attached list since they are pooling points and will not have gas composition information.
2.
POI # 59685 Richfield Gas Storage/NNG Stevens is on the attached list twice.
The gas composition information is tied to meter # 658429 and the throughput activity is reported by the summation meter # 660018.
3.
POI # 1309 CNG/Beaver  - C Line Receipt is including in the attached data since the CNG Beaver processing plant is not running at this time.
The CNG volume is flowing to the Bushton Plant as strangers gas.
Once everyone has gotten a chance to look at this information I would like to have another meeting to discuss the data.

Facts NNG moves 100,000 dts from physical inventory to Offsystem inventory.
No accounting entry made to the G/L.
I will look into Form 2 physical reporting changes.
Offsystem inventory is reduced  2,000 dts to reflect in-kind fuel reduction.
Case 1	In-Kind is replaced by simple purchase from 3rd party, NNG incurrs the cost.
Debit 803 (Gas Purchases) or 858 (Fuel exp)		2,000 * cost of gas 	Credit A/P						2,000 * cost of gas  Case 1 books all transactions outside of operational storage.
Reducing the Offsystem storage will cause UAF to increase, however purchasing gas for Operational Storage and not recording it to Operational Storage will offset the UAF increase.

757,"Beginning  10/1/2001, TMS stopped excluding city gates locations from the allocation, thereby they would be subject to allocation, where they were not before,  this was requested by John Buchanan.
Unfortunately or fortunately, NNG customers do not nominate a large portion of their gas to theses city gate locations, rather they nominate to the zone locations, so there is a 99.9% probability, that these city gates would never have to be allocated any way.
Currently in TMS we exclude the zone nomination locations (OPS type) from the allocation process.
Therefore my question is, since we wanted to include the city gates in the allocation process do we also want to include the zone delivery locations in the allocation process?

Break Field Area in 3 Regions / Allocate by point The decision was made to sub-divide the Field Area storage group into two regions; South of Plainview and North of Plainview, rather than 3 regions or allocating by point.
If it is determined that additional divisions are necessary in the future, such changes can be made at that time.
Changes  to CAS are required.
I have discussed the changes with Bob Johnson and Doug Aschwege and have learned that the changes are not difficult to make and could be made in a couple days.
Gary Spraggins and I will determine which deferred delivery points are in these new field regions and then provide the information to Bob and Doug.
Question:  Should this change be implemented immediately or should it wait until the beginning of the withdrawal season?
Change from 'net zero' approach / Provide minimum level of activity The decision was made to table this concern for now.
The scheduled activity that drives the allocation process does not guarantee physical pipeline operations.
In most cases, the flexibility provided by the Cunningham Field allows Gas Control to adjust operations to maintain the required minimum level of injections/withdrawals into Redfield and Lyons.
Further analysis is required.
Steve Thomas, Larry Swett and I will continue to monitor the system conditions/operations that effect physical storage to determine if and what additional changes maybe warranted.
Send ""Notice"" when final scheduled number exceeds operational capacity The IT group will modify the scheduling cycle to add a procedure where the final net scheduled storage quantity is compared to the operational capacity set for storage.
If the final scheduled quantity exceeds operational capacity, I will receive a notification via e-mail.
The purpose here is to monitor occurrences to determine the magnitude of the problem.
I will get with Gerry Medeles to finalize the matter.

777,"I just ran several Shipper Scheduled Quanties reports and discovered the fomat had changed.
I monitor several contracts for forecasting purposes and also provide Market Services invoicing  information for revenues for negotiated rates and sharing revenues for volumes flowing West for USGT.
I rely upon the Shipper Scheduled Quantities report to get the information I need.
Before the change,  I was able to run 1 report for each of these shippers each week, a total of 3 reports.
Because the new  report does not give me month-to-date totals I now have to run a report for each shipper for each gas day,  a total of 21 reports each week.
It is very time consuming to run and analyze all these reports.
As  Marketing does more of these sort of deals the volume will only grow.
It is critical that I get a report that gives me month-to-date totals so I don't have to run a report for each shipper for each day.
Is there some way you could revise the report to again show the month-to-date totals?
Minor comparisons:  1)  The 2nd portion of the original report had an area where you could quickly glance at either your receipt            or delivery point totals.
In order to get a break out of receipt and delivery points now, you have to run 1             report sorted by receipt point and 1 report by delivery point.
2)	This is very minor, but I also liked the fact that the report was on letter size paper.
All my files have              been set up to accomodate that size of report.
I now have to set up new files.
I appreciate any help you can give me in this matter.
Thanks!

Part of the settlement provides that NNG and its shippers will work together in good faith to develop an imbalance resolution which includes a shipper option of in-kind balancing or cash out.
Also, the working group would define the parameters around which NNG could buy or sell gas into or out of the operational storage account.
Mary Kay has asked that Steve Kirk & myself co-chair this committee for NNG and that the two of you also be members of the committee on behalf of NNG.

183                                  Texas Gas states that this filing is being submitted in compliance with the Commission's Order issued on September 19, 2001 in the above-referenced docket.
As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.
In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.
The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.
Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

This was a follow up meeting where alternate forms of communicating with customers was discussed.

Develop three methods for communicating (Email, Page and voice mail, Pop Up messaging).
Outage and failure communications to go to the HotTap Help Desk, Shelley, Directors and Team Advisors.
Outage and failure communication messages to be distributed from either the Help Desk or Jean McFarland.
EDI possibly could be rolled into the same communication method.

If you need more time to file your return, you can  easily get a filing extension.
And if you can't afford to pay your tax bill now,  you can buy more time to pay up.
While you may be                            subject to interest and penalties for payments  made after April 16, you can put off the day of                            reckoning for months without fear that IRS  collection agents will come after you.
There is even a                            loophole in the law that will enable many  individuals to get an extra month to pay up without being                            assessed interest or penalties.
Nevertheless, April 16 is a critical deadline for  anyone who has yet to file his tax returns.
You'll need                            to file either your tax return or an extension  request by the deadline.
And to avoid interest and                            penalties, you'll generally need to pay any taxes  owed by April 16.
April 16 is also the deadline for making IRA  contributions for 2000 returns and for making the first                            installment of quarterly estimated taxes for 2001.
Filing extension: If you'd like more time to file  your return, getting a filing extension is simple.
In fact,                            the IRS has expanded the options this year for  obtaining a filing extension.
You can now do it by                            phone, computer or mail.

813,"SCA is pleased to inform you there are still available seats in an upcoming ""Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation"" class scheduled in Houston, Texas on October 30-31, 2001.
The class will be held at SCA's offices, 2500 Tanglewilde, Suite 120, from 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday.
Below is the description of the course.
Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation A Must Course for Anyone who Generates or Evaluates Interpretations and Prospects!!!
Description:                     This course addresses the need for a systematic approach for quickly screening prospects and identifying fundamental mapping errors.
The application of the methods used in our Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping course as quick look techniques is the core of this course.
The most common errors found on subsurface prospects are illustrated with numerous examples from throughout the industry.
It's easy to drill a dry hole on a good prospect; it only has to be mapped a little bit wrong.
QLTs are powerful and efficient tools for recognizing sometimes subtle mapping errors that lead to poorly located drilling locations.
The course begins with a review of examples of mapping errors that lead to poorly located wells that were uneconomic or dry.
Methods used to address the risk factors that can cause dry holes are reviewed.
Specific QLTs that can be used to identify critical mapping errors are covered in the remainder of the course.
The course manual is our textbook, ""Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation.""
Who should attend?
Supervisors, managers, vice-presidents, prospect evaluators, and anyone involved in preparing, reviewing or evaluating subsurface interpretations and prospects.
Attendees who have a background  knowledge of  mapping  techniques will  derive a  more  complete  benefit from this course.

One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.
It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.
Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:  		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**  October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview         November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

818,"I hope this finds you and all your close ones well.
What a crazy world we seem to be in at the moment.
We want to communicate to friends and associates some of our current perspectives.
Pre September 11  We had already been operating under the assumption that our economy has been in a recession for a while.
Although the technical definition of recession may not have been achieved, we can't see much difference between positive 0.2% and negative 0.1% economic growth.
We also thought the trillion dollar plus loss in stock market wealth had to manifest itself into a general economic contraction.
We had not expected to see the trends of growing lay offs and shrinking cash flows to turn around until the third quarter of 2002.
Our perspectives have been more pessimistic than the general market up until September 11.
We believe both expansions and contractions can feed off themselves.
The current contraction seemed to validate this.
We also believe it is usually significant events that provide the catalyst to turning these trends.
Post September 11  The events of September 11 will certainly put us in a technical recession.
Now though, we don't expect to see the cash flow contractions and lay offs draw themselves out for as long a period.
The economic contraction will now be steeper, but with the bottom reached sooner.
In crisis mode, Washington is being very proactive at providing stimulus to the economy.
We don't think this would have been the case outside of a crisis.
A significant event has provided us with the stimulus for renewed growth.
We now believe light at the end of the tunnel may appear in the second quarter of 2002, a modest growth environment to appear in the third quarter of 2002 and possible robust growth by the end of next year.
The hole we fall in will be deeper, but now we have much more of a helping hand from Washington.
The Future  There's a lot we all have to be grateful for at this point in time.
We've all benefited from a very long expansion period.
We've lived during the most amazing time in all of human history.
The social, cultural and technologi cal advances man has made over the last two generations are unparalleled in history.
We live in a great country where freedom and prosperity have only grown since our inception.
Our social consciousness has certainly been violated.
We grieve for all those who are suffering.
We pray for them, for our families and ourselves.
We pray for peace and logic to prevail.
This event provides our country with an opportunity to show the strength of our character.
We have faith that operating under the veil of our great value systems, America's leadership will do the best thing for most all world constituencies.
We will set the best example of fairness, yet resolve.
The seeds of our next great economic growth cycle have now been planted.
It is not our technology, or our wealth, or our military strength that will inspire the world.
It's our value systems that will inspire them.
Underneath all the trappings of American culture and prosperity are the foundations of freedom, opportunity, fairness and justice.
These are the American ""products"" that inspire the world to emulate us.
Over time, the world's desire to be more and more like America will drive even greater demand for everything American.
We wish everyone well with the challenges ahead.
Fear not, as an even more fair and honest world, and an even stronger economic growth environment, are right around the corner.

820,"Rick, I wanted to summarize for you my budget meeting with Michael on Wed.
I will send you the whole pack under separate cover, but here are the highlights: 	Relatively speaking, it was constructive - he has made unequivical cut demands of other groups  	Original (adjusted) headcount budget for 2001 was 52, he is asking me to freeze heads at current 44  					which includes: not replacing recent leaver - Karin Levin 							not replacing scheduled Houston rotation - Oliver Harrison 							Scheduled new arrrivals	- John Collenette, Karl Sees, Blair Van Zant, Adam Bauer, Michel Gantois 							Tracy Ngo, plus 5 new in last month.
2002 budget looks much larger than 2001, despite lower headcount due to: $1.6MM increase due to full costing of expats @ salary plus 4x salary (instead of just 											salary) 										$500k for communications allocated 										increase in benefit costs from 10% to 23% 	All other expenses lowered -    Budget not finalized.
Michael requested: reduce Travel by a significant amount ($100k?)
get more precise justification of allocations from RAC Corp -  						Credit - $350k looks a little low (includes you, bill, debbie, credit reserve,CAS..) 						Market - $660 looks a little high/ok 						UndWr - $499 looks too high 						Portfolio - $108 ??
be prepared to shed under 2 scenarios a) 5 heads 										b) 10 heads 5 heads can be accomodated with little change in service, provided we continue to shed 'operational' credit responsibility and the current low level of large underwritten transactions and revals.
Specific coverage holes and weakness will continue to be: EBS, German speaking credit person, depth in international markets, depth in market risk management.
10 heads would be quite disruptive and my recommendation would be to re-assess the role of RAC with an eye towards much less process work and immunity from finger pointing.
Budget to be finalized a more comprehensive business review is completed over the coming few weeks.
Perhaps we can discuss next week after you have reviewed.

822,"Last week we completed preliminary ROCAR calculations on the following deals:  					ROCAR  Georgia Pacific/Leaf River		29.03%  Owens DSM				10.75%  Project Oz				 2.74%   These results place Georgia Pacific at the high end of all of the deals we have looked at so far.
The ROCAR for GP includes the impact of the swap which only slightly improved the return (versus the asset only) due to the credit risk associated with a BBB minus credit.
Owens is about on par with other energy management deals we have seen coming out off EES.
Operational risk (implementation/contract risk) is considered low due to the ongoing nature of the project.
Project Oz is one of the worst deals we have analyzed.
Margins are very thin, and due to the illiquid nature of the asset, market risk is very large (1 day VAR $45MM).

824,"With respect to future Enron guarantees, there are at least three issues to be addressed in addition to the pervasive objective of transitioning out of the parent guarantee:  	1.
Excluding the value of major equipment from the guarantee.
I believe this is already being done for new bids.
2.
Carving out at least part of the guarantee as within Enron's/Nepco's discretion to establish performance or other 	bonding instruments.
3.
Negotiating transferability of the guarantee, i.e.
the guarantee can be assumed by another credit-worthy entity 	with at least investment grade or, if necessary, at least a rating equal to Enron's at the time of assumption.
Since the substantive financial protection afforded by an Enron parent guarantee to the contract value would not be compromised if these are implemented, Enron's corporate position is very likely to push very hard on these points.
Logically, owners and project lenders should be willing to accept these structures--even though there undoubtedly would be strong initial pushback.
On the other hand, there may be a real question whether to accept contracts that do not provide for these relatively small steps away from the traditional hell or high water parent guarantee that Enron has approved in the past.
Discussion of these issues should be included in the DASH.
In any event, each new contract requiring an Enron guarantee will have to be approved by Rick Buy personally.

I wasn't included in the discussions on how this report started up again, so I may not have all the facts on why we're doing what we're doing.
- at a minimum, we should use the Commodity DPR instead of the Business Unit DPR - for example, he was unable to see the 850 Bcf 	NA Gas NOP, or the components thereof as the Business Unit DPR is used  - would it be worthwhile to do a report that shows a week on week comparision of NOP, M/G, and VaR, with a 5-day P/L, based on the 	Concentration Limit DPR?

859,"PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note, with attached order:  Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' ""insider trading proceeds"") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.
You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21.
In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.
You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any ""freeze"" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult ""tracing"" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., ""trace"" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).
The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of ""an equitable accounting,"" wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, ""particularly as to .

The scope included cutting away the bow section, raising and suspending the main section below pontoons, and towing the main section to a drydock in Murmansk.
Extensive simulations and model testing were conducted to develop and validate the lifting and towing operations.
Managing the project required close cooperation with the Russian Navy and the submarine designer to design the overall lifting program.

869,"Rick -   As we discussed, I have an outstanding tax liability with the Australian government, and I need your help in this matter.
Working for Enron Ex-Pat Services, I incurred additional tax liabilities which Enron was to pay on my behalf.
In simple terms, Enron agreed to make up the difference between my U.S. income tax liability and that charged by Australia.
My full U.S. tax liability was withheld from my paychecks and Enron was to make up the difference between this and the 48% charged by the Australian government.
As of today, the incremental tax liability has not been addressed by Enron, and I need to resolve this issue immediately.
It appears that the easiest solution is for Enron Corp. to wire Enron Australia the estimated tax liability, with Enron Australia passing the money to the Australian tax authority.
I will have the final estimate from PWC first thing Monday morning, but it has been indicated that the liability in total will be less than $50,000 U.S..
I appreciate any help you can provide in getting this matter resolved.

For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171 Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08  Taxes withheld = $19,895.

From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities.

The consolidation order grants a motion that we and other defense counsel had made.
It means that all cases in the Houston federal court should proceed in a more orderly, coordinated fashion.
A technical detail - the Order provides for three separate consolidated proceedings before Judge Rosenthal: (i) the federal securities cases; (ii) the derivative cases (at least those that have been filed in federal court); and (iii) the employee benefit plan cases.
Finally, the Order allows parties ten days to file objections to consolidation.

Mike Peterson, who many of you have met and who is working with J.C. on your case, asked me to send the following e-mail to you:  The lawyers for Amalgamated Bank filed an amended class action complaint yesterday.
Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one (our comparison was ""line by line"" but not ""word for word""), it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely, ""to order an accounting of insider-trading proceeds,"" ""disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds,"" ""restitution of investors' monies of which they were defrauded,"" and ""as to the section 11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages.""
These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys.
The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action.

906,"I would see the primary responsibilities:   1.
Develop with Fallon a written process for the valuation of terminated contracts.
We will most likely only have Bjorn for a short period of time given his reluctance to go to NETCO.
While no one appears to care about the fact that we have no way to render a correct value for financial statement purposes, this would be a priority if I was managing the estate.
There is no metric for the approval of comprises internally.
Our curves say one value, the counterparties quotes say another.
Differences in value may be a better metric that notional settlement amounts.
2.
With IT, assure that the terminated contracts are frozen in value.
The book is currently floating, rendering an open position which is unmeasured as to VaR.
Examine ways, if any, to manage this uncovered market risk.
3.
Valuation of assets held for sale and DASH process.
It would appear that we should work backwards from the summary of sale that the Unsecured Creditors Committee wants.
There have already been complaints about multiple forms (DASH, transaction review committee for).
This would require revamping the DASH process and TAP.
4.
Revaluation of International assets.
5.
To the extent EES performs post petition, value this book and the associated  ongoing costs associated with it.
6.
My understanding is that the billing on performing accounts is behind.
Manage and develop a process to collect these past due amounts.
Collectibility does not improve with time.
7.
Ongoing review of business unit's cash requests.
8.
Develop a systematized IT solution to payments and transfers made 90 days prior to bankruptcy (in process).
9.
Manage the bankrupt counterparty portfolio.
10.
Collect amounts owed by PG&E and So Cal Edison ($545 million notional).

907,"Dear Rick,  I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you about my Cash Balance Plan.
My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up this Sunday, December 9.
The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.
HR (Sheila Walton) told me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid severance.
With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable now.
HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.
Benefits stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I would vest.
HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is.
If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on vacation and terminated after the 9th.
I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my termination date after December 9, i.e.
at the earliest next Monday.
I feel that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of information and loads of unanswered questions.
I do not see myself in a position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.

912,"Rick, As follow-up to our discussion of today, we would like to explain our concerns.
EEL entities are under control of an administrator - Price Waterhouse - who represents the interest of the creditors of those entities.
All decisions regarding those entities are being made by the administrator.
Michael Brown, Fernley Dyson, John Sherriff are not in the building and to the best of my knowledge have resigned all directorships.
Most of the remaining employees (300) are working for the administrator.
There are, however, interests of Enron Corp which are housed in Enron House may not be getting the attention they deserve or , potentially more concerning, are being used or eyed by the locals for their benefit.
Examples are : 1) the contractual assets in ECTRIC which include financial trades, weather derivatives, nordic energy, some crude and products trading.
2) large in the money pumped storage trade which is in a US-based LLC - in the money by a net $50MM 3) Enron Direct is being offered for sale (JV with EES) 4) The TXU VPS contracts (currently under termination dispute) is being negotiated solely by administrators and their employees  Transactions are being terminated by counterparties, deals are being cut between the administrators and commercial for the dispostion of assets, and value is being eroded because no support staff will work without a reasonable expectation of being paid.
Finally, the administrators have been here for several weeks and seem woefully prepared to take on the task at hand.
We suggest that the Houston-based 'investor' (whether that is current managment or a trustee) ought to reconstitute some form of governance over its activities in Europe so that it can be assured of receiving maximum value for its assets here.
Currently, we have little capability to cause the local staff to provide us with the information and access to make informed decisions.
Please give us a call so we can discuss a course of action, if any, you would like us to take.

Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people.
We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

923,"Rick/Bill/David, Generally, we have managed to keep our main counterparts transacting, but things are tight.
We are signing netting agreements and agreeing to collateral threshholds, but we are negotiating hard where we think that we will be so close to collateral lines in the next few months that we would actually have to post.
As we go into this week, we need to hold on to those we have, incrementally open up a few more, and start to get people to business as usual.
Amongst the things that continues to be missing are the OFFICIAL STORY (we have access to the newspaper here, too), good communication regarding global relationships, and calendar and status of new developments regarding credit facilities, equity issuance/raising.....  Not that some of it is getting through, it just comes through random channels and we know very little more than our counterparts that have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.
To that end, it has been suggested here that Houston (PR?)
with RAC/Finance develop a daily script of talking points for the masses.
We have traders and credit people talking all day to counterparts - they really could use a strong story to tell without have to think about it.
I am very confident that I can tell a reasonable story myself, but I am concerned that I do not have all the facts at my disposal and my guess is that the average trader/credit specialist is probably at a greater disadvantage.

938,"I have received questions about interpreting the ratio.
Let me use yesterday's closing price.
The merger probability is derived from a two scenario test, merger closure or merger non closure (there is also a competing offer scenario in reality).
Let's use a closing DYN price of $46.20 yesterday (note I had a typo), at the exchange ratio, (not taking into account timing and dividends), this yields a merged ENE price of $12.40 ($46.20 * .2685).
ENE closed at $10.00 yesterday.
Thus if the market thought there was complete certainty of merger, the prices would converge at $12.40.
Now comes the artful part, the non merger ENE price.
I included another tab (Merger) to sensitize this.
Say we pick an ENE price with no merger of $4.00.
Looking at a deterministic probability, one can look at the distance (difference) in dollars to calculate the probability.
For instance:  ENE merged           12.40 ENE close 14-Nov   10.00 ENE no merger         4.00  Probability of merger = (1-((12.40-10.00) / (12.40 - 4.00))) or 71.4%.
Said another way, there is a 71.4% chance of being worth $12.40 and a 28.6% chance of being worth $4.00, which yields a weighted price of $10.00  ($12.40 * 71.4%)+($4.00 * 28.6%).
I also included a $1 distressed ENE price and a $7 previously observed low end ENE price as scenarios.

Dynegy is already on the Committee.
Important hearings in the PG&E bankruptcy are scheduled for December.
These hearings should begin to vet the issue of preemption, or the ability of the federal bankruptcy court to preempt state law under the bankruptcy code, thus freezing out the CPUC from ruling on the transfer of PG&E's generating assets to FERC jurisdiction.
We continue settlement discussions PG & E.   Including offsets in our trading contracts, our net nominal exposure to PG&E is $511 million.
The claim is disputed primarily due to the pending FERC refund case.
In initial discussions, Enron offered a $85 million discount.

Security is an ability you possess to protect specific assets in specific way(s).
So the answer is:  Security is able to reduce risk in specific areas but without the full breadth of risk defined it is impossible to determine how significant security solutions are.

",Security vs Risk
944,"... how about an LBO?
Certain high net worth executives sponsor the deal in conjunction with a major financial investor such as JPM/Chase or Citibank.
Force the share trust participants to go along and cut in all management and employees.
It gets the company out of the spotlight and might have some real attraction for deal starved investors... esp at this price level.
It could remotivate everyone and provide a way to recover some of the lost value that had accrued to the employees over the years.
Obviously, some stakeholders would do better that others but that's the way it goes sometimes.
Just a thought.
Hang in there.

We are currently anticipating project close on July 27th, but as with all things associated with India the date will probably slide some.
Here'e what we are planning to do for Corp approval.
1) Steve Harper is working with Brad Larson to get a RAC document completed along the lines of the package we prepared for the China sale last month.
This should be completed early next week and either your group or Steve will get it circulated for sign-offs.
2) We (Detmering/Sherrick) will review the project with Skilling/Lay prior to Rac sign-off.
Based on our last discussion, we will not need board approval for this sale since it is less than $500 million.
If this is not correct, let me know ASAP.
Otherwise, we will do the above and plan to close on July 27th.

This transaction has been given a legal risk ranking of 2.0 (on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0 indicating minimal legal risk), primarily due to potential post-closing indemnification obligations.
The legal risks discussed in this memo were also set forth in the DASH; however, please note the following correction to the DASH:  while the Enron entities' pro rata share of the maximum potential liability under the seller indemnity is $20.7 million, Enron and the other sellers have joint and several liability for indemnification obligations which are capped at $30 million, and Enron will be liable for the entire $30 million if the non-Enron sellers cannot satisfy their pro rata share of the liability under the seller indemnity (note that Enron is not guaranteeing or backstopping the other sellers' share of this liability in any way; however, the purchaser may choose to hold Enron liable for the entire liability, and leave Enron to pursue the other sellers for their share).

962,"Rick, There are very few single issues that require urgent consultation with you, however there are lots of little things that you may want to be aware of: 	We had an FSA 'Traded Risk' 2-day audit the past two days.
The operations/risk group bore the brunt of the work but Michael Pitt and I spent some time with them as well and we did do some level of preparation.
Jonathon Marsh, our compliance guy, seeemed very pleased with the result.
You never get away clean, but I think that they were impressed with the effort as well as the Enron risk culture.
by the way, my opinion of both Jonathan Marsh and Paul Freeman, the new technology guy is quite high - they are both good guys who want to make positive changes and not afraid to say whats on their mind.
2 risk policy issues came up - one regarding credit trading and the other regarding the freight book wanting to lay off credit risk with the credit book.
these we are slated to discuss with you tomorrow.
There are 2 new bad credits in Metals - 1 related to McCook where two of the 3 companies in the group declared ch 11 - we are owed est.
$7.5MM 		the other co. is the one that has granted us a free gigantic option on tolling ally for power - the commercial team is attempting to work out a situation 		where we transfer the unsecured claims to the ch 11 entities to a first security package on the smelter in co 3.
The other bad deal is a lead company out ogf the NY office where they owe us $450K on financials and we owe them $1MM on physicals - we are working on netting the positions  There are a number of deals being worked on surrounding TPL ppa's in which the power positions would be taken on by Enron and we would get cash to either extinguish or re-mark the price (the purchases are way out of the money).
There are 3 in the negotiation process - each big - not at the decision or DASH stage.
we had a DASH signed off while I was away on ETOL for a gas turbine in which we get tolling in exchange for a capacity payment.
I assume you are up to speed on the tragedy at TPL yesterday.
Norway is looking at 2 large power prepays with municipal generators - low probability  we will be circulating a DASH on $2MM more into Thrace - turkish e&p and pipeline play - total exp =$7.25MM 	team worked extensively with Jim ledlow and Brad on the analysis.
deal looks fine on the surface - 46% iirr vs 35% capital price.
only real issue is 'do we want to sink more $ into Turkey in order to improve the chances of a good sale or do we just put progress on hold'  good news is that $1.5mm is coming from cash flow from the project.
We have in the works one of the few EES NA-type deals with Guiness at a single facility.
$9mm in capital.
in the markets, we do not seem to be doing particularly well of late - Norway is down, uk gas has gotten caught in a short squeeze, uk power has lost a little, metals is metals .... things are moving on the personell front as well: Rudi starts monday Mike Mumford (internal transfer from Enron Credit) start 9/3 Tracy comes in mid September Blair van Zant -Director credit starts on 9/30

965,"The doorstep audit is not yet complete as I'm having about 25 or so deals ""tested"" out of the Long Beach office.
We should know all final results within the next week or so.
Rick-your suggestions are generally on target as we have already begun the process for pulling each specific office's information together-ie: how many offices do we have, who are the specific people in them, what do they transact on (DSM, gas/power commodity, services mgmt., etc), and can we consolidate/minimize the number of offices we have.
For example, of the 87-ish offices that we currently have EES folks in, only 14 of those offices have individuals that transact gas or power deals in the EnronDirect sales group (ie:  customers below $10 million in energy spend) and there are @ 45 sales folks in these 14 offices.
The losses now expected out of the Long Beach office are MUCH lower than initial estimates.
If anyone would like to review, please call me directly.
We are already well underway in establishing new transaction process' for both gas and power deals.
Although we have already put in place and communicated these new procedures to each of the sales offices, we are putting together a ""sales package"" that will encompass each of the new procedures in detail, each of the new gas and power contracts and rules for use, and a new sales policy which will review in detail the responsibilities for each sales individual.
This policy will require signatures from the sales folks in order for them to continue working for EES in a sales transaction role.
We are also exploring an independent verification process whereby we would have someone from either Deal Capture or Deal Management actually contact the customer to confirm the transaction.

gas = $61MM as before).
So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the ""Big Buckets"" and the Business Units.
I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know.
I said I would come back on that.
I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?).
Cleared it with Whalley today (he laughed), mentioned the dwindling membership of the Risk Management Committee and said ""In my current role I think I should be asking for limits, not approving them""  ...and then...  2	The gas desk lost $98MM yesterday  A combination of a very bullish AGA number (3 Bcf injection - not a typo - three Bcf !)
plus some hurricane activity in the gulf sent prices up by between 25 and 30c all across the strip.
The long and the short of it was we are long Nov - Jan but short (big-time) out beyond that - the rest is arithmetic.
So we have two flavors of P&L notification, one at the business unit level (Americas) $89MM loss against VaR limit of $82MM; the other as a commodity, losing $126MM (the desk aren't the only ones with a gas position, as usual) against the Big Bucket number of $100MM.
Total trading was a loss of $106MM against a VaR limit of $150MM so no calls to Pug required (thank goodness).
That's it for now, hope you're having fun and remember: pan-fry the big ones and throw back the little ones.

The motions were directed primarily to Arthur Andersen and, to a lesser degree, to Enron.
None of your names were mentioned at the hearing.
Arthur Andersen and one of the plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed on a proposed order for preserving documents.
Other plaintiffs' lawyers said that the agreed order was not stringent enough.
With respect to Enron, there is some doubt as to whether the court can enter any order regarding Enron, because that may be the exclusive purview of the bankruptcy court.
Although the issue of which attorney should be appointed lead counsel was not technically before the court, most of the hearing was consumed with the various plaintiffs' lawyers arguing that the court should select them to be lead counsel.
The court said that it would not rule on the motion regarding preservation of documents until after 3:00 tomorrow.
All of the plaintiffs' lawyers are to get together in the next 24 hours to see if they can agree amongst themselves as to what they want the court to do.

991,"Rod, Stan and Rick,  Pursuant to your request, I have visited PGE last week and had conversations with the respective PGE employees.
Below are my conclusions and analysis.
In Retrospect (Jan-01 - Sep-01)  Background During this period PGE has negotiated a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that limits PGE risks and rewards.
According to this mechanism, PGE is responsible for only 10% of the costs in excess of $232.5 MM.
Earlier in the year, PGE has accumulated the length for the 2001-2002 period that appreciated in value significantly as prices were increasing.
Since liquidations on the hedges are included in the power costs, this value has offset the company's power costs and pushed the total cost of power in the deadband, where PGE wears 100% of risks and rewards.
Earnings Impact As prices continued to decline against the long position, PGE incurred significant power costs from its hedge liquidations and moved through the deadband, where the Company wears 100% of the downside.
Other items that impacted earning included: 	- reduced load during the period 	- reserves for CA receivables 	- losses in spec trading  For the remainder of the PCA, through the end of Sep-01, PGE is only responsible for 10% of the incurred power costs.
Analysis In my opinion, the following factors have affected PGE's decision to maintain the length in a bearish market:  	- bullish or not as bearish sentiment among traders 	- reliability issues: PGE has significant political and financial repercussions for being caught short in a blackout 	- psychological fears of tight power supplies and potential blackouts/brownouts, mainly because of recent situation in CA  Next 15 Months (Oct-01 - Dec-02)  PGE has agreed to implement a similar PCA mechanism for the next 15 months.
Below are the highlights: 	 - PGE is currently negotiating the base cost level with the PUC.
This is a critical step to ensure that PGE's estimate of the 15-months baseline power costs, as agreed with 	the PUC, is equal to or greater than the actual costs for the period (~$984 MM) - the new PCA provides for tighter bands (+/- $28 MM for 100% exposure) - transmission costs, resulting from load variations are not factored into the PCA mechanism - Given tighter bands, PGE will begin to place greater emphasis on the spec book - MTM earnings  Beyond 2002  PGE is naturally short beyond 2002 (load exceeds generation and hedges).
PGE could begin discussions with the PUC on the structure of a new PCA mechanism to limit their risk and rewards; or move towards greater deregulation.
There is a possibility that PGE will loose some of its industrial commercial load during this time period, with an obligation to take them back at a standard offer.
In the meantime, the Company began purchasing power for the 2003-2004 time period to cover residential load.
Recommendations/Action Steps  1.
Design decision authority process for significant business decisions.
In retrospect, it would be helpful to analyze the value of the long position against the cost of reliability and make a decision accordingly.
Other examples: should PGE apply for a PCA mechanism past 2002, should PGE be purchasing power for 2003-2004.
Also, participate regularly in the PGE Risk Management Committee meetings.
2.
Continue to improve trading controls (missed a deal earlier in the year resulting in a $10 MM loss in the spec book).
Significant improvements have been made since then.
- move settlements function under middle office to ensure segregation of duties - currently reports through the commercial function 	- capture option exposure ASAP or prohibit option trading: PGE has an option trade in the books that is not captured in the risk management and reporting 			framework (position, P&L and VaR) 	- develop processes for capturing other exposures: 		Interest rates, embedded in commodity cash flows and assets 		Foreign currency, resulting from transactions with Canadian counterparties in CAD$ 		Heating Oil #2, PGE has ~ 1 MM Bbls in storage at the Beaver Plant 		Coal, two-year contract for supply of coal to the Boardman Plant  3.
Daily reporting of PGE risks: VaR, Positions and P&L, notifications of limit violations; as well as, notification of important transactions (purchase of 2003-2004 power)  4.
Input/coordination with EWS on important trading decisions.
Insights from the West Desk could help PGE make better trading decisions.
5.
Periodic review of trading controls - add PGE to the list of Doorstep projects.
I would be glad to provide additional details.

992,"Here are my thoughts on some of Pug's comments (Karen has faxed the memo from Pug I believe):  1	Roles of Audit and Finance Committees  I agree with the distinction he draws and I don't see why the entire Board should not see risk/return information.
We can tweak the policy to bring this to the fore.
2	Post-Audit  I'll talk to Gorte  3	Capital Allocation  Complex.
Charges for risk capital would not be as difficult as allocating funding.
Building balance sheets is key.
4	Trading Limits  In my last tome I have effectively limited the use of D-VaR to the levels specified by the concentration buckets, so I think we have satisfied that concern.
With position limits I would argue that ones needs them where VaR does not ""callibrate"" well, for example with Steel trading where there is no observable options market, you need more metrics to tell you about the risk.
Conversely in US Gas I think the market is fairly deep and the VaR tells us much about the risk.
Also, in a similar fashion to ""model approval"" under Basle Capital Adequacy rules, the quality of the risk administration process and other controls could make us more comfortable about just using VaR.
5	Reporting  Policy Section 4.1.2.3.1 talks about violations and notifications.
He is asking should he not be called for a five day loss (c) and an ETL excess (d), in addition to the usual corporate VaR breach and one day loss > VaR.
I think the five day loss actually would warrant a Pug call because under the new method (5 day loss > 225% of VaR), the number could be very large (but also less likely).
For ETL I would advise against having a Pug call on this since we still need to get the metric bedded down properly (and all the usual arguments about the math played out).
The phrase ""at their discretion"" to which he refers means that the Risk Committee can tell who they like about violations, as they deem necessary - so its just built-in flexibility.
6	Liquidity  We are cranking this right now.
Other news  Gas off approximately 15c across the strip today - Friday was quiet.
George has made $9m over the last 5 days as crude has come off 50 - 60c ENE is $36 (horrible)  DP

1007,"Rick - further to our discussion, here is the change Enron Americas are requesting in their limit structure:  Eliminate volumetric limits on net open position and maturity gap; Eliminate limits on individual commodities within the business unit; Replace with one limit, expressed in VaR, for the entire business unit, of $100MM.
I am not uncomfortable with $100MM, given the opportunity set and the required returns from this activity.
ETL at this level could be in the region of $340MM.
I think the other things to consider in making the decision are as follows:  Does the VaR tell us sufficient about the risk ?
I think it does since we have the ability to see components of it in some detail and it backtests well  Tail Risks  Generally we have the most data on tail risks for US gas and power and we are most confident about the EVaR and ETL measures for these commodities.
Liquidity  This should be a key point in removing volumetric limits because they give us a concept of size.
Our recent analysis has shown that our ability to unload risk in US natural gas certainly is high (50% reduction, 10 days) - but we need to continually revisit this analysis.
Administration of Risk  Generally I think we are comfortable - deal capture is good since so many trades are picked up through EOL.
Delegation of authority using VaR limits at desk level is strong   But since VaR is so dependent on MTM values and curves I would still recommend a review of:  curve validation results; ageing of confirmations outstanding (in and out); flash to actual differences (if any)  Compliance with Policy  The policy requires limits under the business unit by ""commodity groups"" in some combination of volumetric and VaR limits.
We also must approve products/commodities for a business unit.
One interpretation of this is to define the commodity ""group"" as the aggregate of gas, power, coal, crude, and approve those products, in which case the aggregate limit for the business unit is the commdity group limit also - so we can have one limit.
Our concern about the Firm blowing up because everyone is short crude, for example, is covered by the fact that we can still see all the components of our aggregate risk to a single commodity, which is also capped by the concentration limits.
The only question is from a governance standpoint, how you prevent yourself bumping up against those and having to explain it to the board.
Another side of this argument is the ""10K analogy"" - if I put $100MM into my 10K via a mutual fund I am likely to want them to declare in which markets they invest it.
To summarize, I think we could justify losing volumetric limits for this business.
On the question of level of risk and commodity limits, I think we should talk it over with Greg / Ken.

1023,"Rick and Greg,  I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.
This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from  source systems, i.e.
risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.
Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.
The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.
They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.
The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.
We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:  1) the ability to track data ""accuracy"" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique ""failures"".
How complete is the data?
2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)
3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows  4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

1045,"Rick   I spoke with Mr. Causey this morning and moved over here.
We have been working with your IT people on security but this is a new practice for us that we are having great success in the energy companies.
As we have worked with more companies on the finance side of businesses we have had to eliminate the IT terms so it makes a lot more sense to Risk Managers now.
e-Risk Management starts with a way to manage the risks of e-commerce such that these risks are understood from the technologists to the board room and you can manage it.
Since this is such a new and radically different concept I have found our literature confuses more often than it helps.
It has some basic tenants that are straight forward that can be presented and understood but are not easy to write down.
It is not a product.
First, we are going to define risk as the potential reduction in assets from the threats of e-commerce.
Now, you have more intangible assets than tangible assets so that we have mastered.
So this discussion is on the asset management side and is a key concept to understand.
Everything else is based on that.
Often we get in an income vs. balance sheet discussion.
In your case you have $11B in book value and $27B in market value so you have $16B in intangible assets.
There are two things to do with these assets 1) protect them as you become e-commerce enabled and 2) figure out how to leverage and grow them with e-business.
So this is where we start.
On the protection side e-commerce threats will come two ways.
Your largest threats are going to be on transactions, like trading, asset acquisition or payments.
Other threats will come from vulnerabilities in your network.
So this is both in trading, business strategy and Information technology.
That is the e-Risk management side.
On the growth side once we and you allocate these $16B of intangible assets to categories, strategies can be built to grow selected areas.
Of course, fixed IT assets have a high need to be leveraged also.
Approximately 25% of your IT budget is managing boxes ( fixed assets) that has no competitive value.
That is what we are doing at Chevron.
For protection you can throw an infinite amount of technology dollars at the e-commerce security requirement and not eliminate the risk (if you pin your technology people to the wall they will finally admit this).
However, once you have e-Risk Management you can manage the costs of technology and risk to what we call ""The Most Favored Case"" investment.
Companies have found this e-Risk concept should be completed before a security policy is developed because until you do understand the asset risk you don't know what to write a security policy to do.
Let me know if you need more.
Many energy companies, especially the utilities, have added e-Risk to Risk Management.
Many recognize e-Risk as the biggest going forward.
This is aimed at getting that elevated Risk Management concept under way.
Normally we would like to come in for an introduction meeting ( 1 1/2 hours) to get the basic concepts covered and then talk about what our e-Risk Practice does.
We are at Keller Springs and the Tollway in North Dallas if you wanted to come here.
Thanks.

The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction.
This is consistent with past practice (although presumably only business unit, RAC, and legal sign-offs would occur prior to committee review) and with your memo of earlier today.

1056,"Rick/Mark: As discussed with you yesterday, the Enron Credit book has exposure to industries which have been negatively impacted by the events of last week.
Credit spreads have widened out in most sectors that demonstrate liquidity and remain unchanged in markets that have yet to find liquidity.
The Enron Credit book is net long protection/short risk which should be beneficial to P/L in the short-term, but there is significant default risk remaining in the book.
The exposures quoted below are gross notional exposures.
There will likely be significant recovery in the event of a default.
The primary risk is in the following sectors:  Airlines AMR Corp/Del	- Short $10MM protection Boeing Co. - Long $20MM protection British Airways Plc - Short $3MM protection Delta Airlines - Short $30MM protection Deutsche Lufthansa AG - Long $17MM protection Quantas Airways Ltd - Short $10MM protection Southwest Airlines - Net flat  The positions that we are concerned about are Delta and AMR.
Continental has announced that it may miss an interest payment early next week.
Insurance/Reinsurance Axa - Short $10MM protection; short $5mm bonds; net short $5mm protection Conseco Inc. - Short $5MM protection; short $4mm bonds; net short $1mm protection  Additionally, we have mark-to-market counterparty credit exposure of $5.7mm to CNA, $5.8mm to Ace, 10.7mm to FSL,$3.6mm to MBIA, $10 mm to Mitsui.
Reserves have been taken for all counterparty exposure.
The biggest concern here is CNA.
Lodging/Leisure Carnival Corp. - short $20MM protection Hilton Hotels Corp. - Short $25MM protection  Many of the short positions are in the insurance portfolios where we have purchased  2nd loss protection  and retain the 1st loss.

There was  considerable discussion which I have summarized below.
Returns: were the returns sufficient to syndicate the risk.
I answered  positively, which is what the capital price addresses.
The dash return is a  blended debt and equity return.(?)
Was the $19 million excess proceeds enough to allow the company to operate.
I  answered yes since 85% of reserves are producing and little capital will be  needed to develop pdnp and pud reserves.
Is management capable of operating or will they be in chapter 11 again soon.
I answered that the bankruptcy was a result of overpaying for Wyoming deal  and low commodity prices last two years which resulted in a bb decrease below  outstanding.
We will have to watch this issue carefully.
Are banks reluctant to support KCS and could this cause a liquidity problem?
Answered that all creditors were made whole and likely that someone will come  into credit but it was a risk, although for the time being they had enough  cash to operate.

Goal: Total Foreign Exchange Exposure quantified and communicated to BOD.
Performance: Project completed with final tranche of results reported to Finance Committee  Dec 11.
The notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on  earnings and CTA accounts have been quantified and reported to the BOD over  the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to.
Also, a  template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes  in the future.
Enron has never had a comprehensive review of FX exposure  prior to this activity.
As an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging  activity resulting from this effort.
Goal: Establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to EES.
Performance: Systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across  EES.
A thorough study of the DSM business has been completed and the results  presented to the Finance Committee.
A RAC task force has been put in place  which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that EES has  agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit  control systems where they need to be.
Significant progress has been made  against these recommendations.
DSM projects have been spot tested with  outside measurement firm and the results reported to EES.
These tests have  highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best  employed.
Goal: Solidify the global risk management policy beyond Houston and London.
Performance: Complete and Ongoing.
During 2000, Project Doorstep was initiated by RAC  which inspected every office within Enron to determine if trading was taking  place and if so whether the Enron controls were being adhered to.
A data base  system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these  offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to.
Doorstep was a huge effort involving RAC, AA, and operations to really  understand where we have risks.

I also spoke with M. Kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ TXU to  pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract  is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank.
Moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with TXU  through the plant purchase or other structured deal.
Do no more (large) deals  with TXU that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??)

Regardless of who leads this effort we need  following:  Commitment of EES back office staff people  Commitment of IT resources Commitment of Skilling to fund the overage to the RAC budget, which I am  under huge pressure to reduce, not increase.

",EES Task Force
1102,"As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams  that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it  expands both in volume and scope.
Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided  the names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be  adjusted from time to time.
Only the more senior people were included, but  others will be included as appropriate.
Many will have to be  multidimensional.
There will be no formal leader of the teams because each  member is responsible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC  group that you are in.
Following are several thoughts concerning this process  for consideration.
- The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the  commercial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
- Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heightened  awareness of RAC issues.
""De-silo-ization"" .
- All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
- Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitude  among the teams.
- Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
-  Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues.
Transactions will  require more frequent informal meetings.
- There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of  credit, market risk or our portfolio.
- All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction.
Offer to  help out if needed.
- If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
- Encourage weak links in team to perform.
- Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the business  unit with the team present.
This may take one quarter to implement.
- If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange it  with your supervisor.
- Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the PRC  and compensation processes.
The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a  catalyst to the recent reorganization there.
You can have an impact.
This process should begin immediately.
Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.

1118,"Please respond to Larry,  I spoke with Darron Blackburn regarding the Burger, Crane, and Sonora accounts.
Darron has told me that the blue fee return sheets indicate that EOTT submitted zero fees for these three accounts.
Darron indicated that these sites had either NSPS sources or an active Title V permit.
Therefore, fees would be required.
A fee would not be required if there was no intention of operating the sites in the 2002 fiscal year (September 1, 2001 through August 31, 2002).
1.
If a fee is owed but the site did not operate in 2000, then EOTT would owe the minimum fee - $26.
2.
If the Title V was not officially terminated prior to Nov.1, then the fee is required if the source operates in the fiscal year.
Our database shows Burger and Sonora to be out of service.
Therefore, a 2002 fiscal year fee would not be required.
This needs to be communicated to Mr. Blackburn in writing.
Our database shows Crane to have all grandfathered tanks.
Therefore, the only trigger for a fee would be an active Title V permit.
Do you know if the TNRCC has voided the Title V and if so when?

1125,"I am trying to compile a list of engines with catalytic converters that will be subject to Compliance Assurance Monitoring (CAM) regulations.
All of the following four conditions must be met for CAM to apply: 1.
The emission unit must be located at a facility with a Title V permit.
2.
The emission unit must be subject to an emission limitation or standard, including a permit condition, for an applicable regulated air pollutant.
3.
The emission unit must use an add-on control device to achieve compliance with the emission limit or standard.
4.
The emission unit must have ""potential pre-control device emissions"" equal to or greater than the amount required for a source to be classified as a major source under Title V (i.e.
100 tpy for criteria pollutants and 10/25 tpy for HAPs).
If an emission unit is subject to CAM then a CAM Plan must be prepared and submitted with a Title V Permit application/renewal.
I will develop a standard plan for submission.
A list of all the engines with catalytic converters is attached based on Power Services database.
Review the list for accuracy.
In addition, update the Title V status of each facility.
The last two columns (major for CO w/o controls and major for NOx  w/o controls) are based on AP-42 factors for rich-burn engines and a specific heat rate of 8500 Btu (LHV)/bhp-hr converted to 9350 Btu (HHV)/bhp-hr to determine whether a unit would be major for CO or NOx pre-control.
Review the permits for the units that would be major for NOx and/or CO to determine if an emission limitation or standard applies to the pollutant for which the unit would be major.
Let me know by January 15 which units you believe will require a CAM plan.

1142,"The following additions and modifications to Stack Manager will be effective as of Saturday September 8, 2001.
Stack Manager Modifications  Inactivate All Stack - In addition to the individual Activate/Inactive Stack buttons, there is now an Inactivate All Stack button.
Similar to the Suspend All button, this button will inactivate the trader's stack on all active products.
Any existing top of stack limit orders will continue to post to the website and remain transactable.
See screen shot below: Inactivate All Stack button on far right.
Please note that we have switched the positions of the suspend and inactivate buttons in Stack Manager.
Fill Order - If a product is set up as either Restricted Top of Stack or Top of Stack the trader now has the ability to automatically fill any order that is at the top of the stack.
In order to fill a limit order that is at the top of the product's stack, which will appear in pink, the trader should right click anywhere on the stack window and choose ""Fill order"".
The volume filled on an order will be that which is offered by the trader.
In order to fill the complete volume of the order, the trader will need to adjust the volume in his stack.
Floated Stack windows - If the stack is inactive on a product, the price and volume fields on the my products tab will continue to be blank.
On the depth window and floated stack window of these products the trader's prices will be in gray and italics.
Children of products that have inactive stacks will not be gray and italicised in the floated stack windows and will not see the calculated prices.
No Auto Inactivate Stack - It is now possible to keep a product active even if the trader is not logged into Stack Manager.
If the trader wishes to enable this functionality on the upper right corner of the product properties page the trader should choose ""No Auto Inactivate when Stack Manager is down"".
Changes regarding Suspension of products  Stack Manager will inactivate products rather than suspend them in the following cases:  ?
Market Close - If a product is active at the end of its trading hours its stack will automatically become inactive rather than suspending.
In order to keep a product's stack active past the set trading hours, the trader should choose ""Keep Awake"" next to the trading hours section of the product properties page.
?
Auto Suspend now inactivates stack - On a product with the Auto Suspend function enabled to monitor the price changes on the product, the product's stack will be inactivated if the Suspend at level is reached.
This feature can be used by checking the Enable box on the product properties page under the Auto Suspend section.
?
Logging Out of Stack Manager- When you log out of Stack Manager without inactivating or suspending your products, the system will now inactivate your products rather than suspending them.

The versions are based on the current Settlement Adjustment (SA1) csv files minus the Supplemental Invoice csv files which were posted just after the original April 2001 billing.
(See attached file: April_2001_SA1_Version_Mapping.xls)

1144,"The invoices for August 2001 settlements were posted by 10:42 AM today, Saturday, September 8, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in posting these invoices a day after they were scheduled.
The Customer Settlements group makes every effort to render accurate invoices on a timely basis.
Although issued a day after their scheduled posting, the invoices are still being issued within the 5-business days.
{I'd forgotten about Labor Day when I set up the schedule.}
Transmission Customers will observe adjustments for an error on in May 2000 Settlement  Adjustment  invoices  that  were  issued  in  July.
The total adjustment  amounted to $2,081,568.11 and was allocated across 2,261,753.08 MWh.
Customers  may  validate  their  respective adjustments by computing their  ratio  shares  of  the  $2,081,568.11  using  2,261,753  MWh  as the denominator  in  their respective ratios of their May 2000 load.
The reason the  denominator of the ratio share appears small is because the pay out of this  adjustment is to the Transmission Owners.
In order not to assess the TO's  a  proportionate  share  of the $2,081,568.11, which would defeat the purpose  of  the  adjustment, their withdrawals have been excluded from the ratio share.
Transmission Owners should observe a credit on their invoices based upon their respective megawatt-mile coefficients for the period.
With  regard  to  the  November 1999 & December 1999 settlement adjustments that  were  scheduled  to  be issued on the 7th, the NYISO intends to issue those  invoices  next  week.
The issuance dates will ensure that customers will have at least 5 business days to review the invoices prior to payments being due to the NYISO.
If necessary, the NYISO will reschedule settlement dates  for these months should our reconciliations take longer to complete; however, we do not anticipate this at this time.
In  addition,  I'd  like to take this opportunity to clarify a point that I made  in  a  TIE  posting  regarding  the  rebilling  of  the  August  25th settlements.
The  initial  billing runs for August 25th were done without considering  ConEd's  sub-zonal  load.
As a result, it appeared as though there  was no load in the ConEd sub-zones on the 25th and all DAM purchases and  bilateral transactions in those sub-zones were sold back to the market in  real  time  causing  the  Schedule  1 residual adjustment to be grossly inflated.
The reason this occurred was due to what appears to have been a frame  relay  problem  between the NYISO & ConEd resulting in the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd.
By no means was my email notification of this event  to  imply that ConEd was not complying with the daily load provision process.
This was merely a hardware/communications issue.

More than 3,000 Enron employees took the time to respond to our survey.
Your honest opinions and time are appreciated and will help us continue to bring you products and services that you deem important in your life, as well as the service that you expect.
We are pleased to report these areas where you have had a positive experience (based on Good, Very Good, and Excellent ratings), in comparison to last year's ratings:  				2001	2000 	Friendliness		88%	84% 	Courtesy		89%	84% 	Knowledge/Training	86%	80% 	Range of Services	87%	82% 	Saving Interest Rates	66%	60% 	Loan Interest Rates	65%	58% 	Quality of Service	88%	84% 	Communications	84%	79% 	Web Portal		72%	N/A 	Service Wait Time	79%	68%   Of course, there is always room for improvement.
Based on your written comments, we have determined these areas where we would like to improve:  ATM Access - We are working with various vendors to develop a program that offers you more free ATM access options and hope to be able to offer this program soon.
We will let you know as soon as a program is available.
In the meantime, members are encouraged to get cash one of these ways to avoid fees:  -  Use your VISA Check Card to get cash back at merchants.
These are fee-free transactions.
-  Use our ATM in the lobby of the Enron Building or 3 Allen Center, or try the approximate 100 fee-free ATMs in the Houston area that display the Select ATM logo (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  Visit one of our Service Center branches (visit enronfcu.com for locations).
-  We will also waive our fee on 3 unaffiliated ATM transactions per month.
Phone Accessibility - In January 2001, we established a phone center to answer incoming calls to our main number.
An automated system initially prompts you, but the option to speak to a live operator is available.
Your call may be forwarded to an EFCU representative, and you may get voice mail.
In this instance, we will return your call as soon as possible.
Should you get voice mail, it will help us process your request more efficiently if you leave your name, phone number, member number and the nature of your call.

Wait Lines - Unfortunately, due to space constraints, we are unable to expand our financial services area (new accounts) right now.
We do recognize that this does at times cause a back up and apologize for the inconvenience.
We are making plans to expand when possible.
We added several tellers this year to help the traffic flow in the teller area and are now filled to capacity at all stations.
As you know, the teller lines are sometimes heavy on paydays.
To help minimize your wait time, here are a few other options to handle your transactions:  -  Make deposits & withdrawals at our ATMs in the Enron Building Lobby or 3 Allen Center.
Deposits are retrieved between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m. and are posted the same day.
-  Make deposits at our Night Drop Box on the 3rd floor of the Enron Building, outside of the EFCU front doors.
The Night Drop Box is checked throughout the day and transactions are posted the same day if received by 5:00 p.m. -  Sign up for Direct Deposit.

Among the games missed by many people were, in college games, Michigan/Michigan St.; Stanford/Washington; UCLA/Washington St.; Illinois/Purdue; and Texas A&M/TexasTech.
In the pros, Baltimore/Pittsburgh was not a good game for most people, Seattle/Washington was a bad one and NY/Jets/New Orleans was missed by most people, while Kansas City/San Diego was not correctly picked by anyone.
We had 31 entries this week, making the pot $93.
Currently in the lead is Robert Vargas, with only 6 games missed.
No one else had 6 wrong, while Carter Ellis was the only one with 7 wrong.
Robert picked Denver tonight, while Carter picked Oakland.
Therefore, if Denver wins, Robert will win outright; if Oakland wins, then it will come down to the total points scored.
Robert chose 49, while Carter choose 30.
Therefore, if Oakland wins and there is 40 or more points, then Robert will win, 39 or less with Oakland, then Carter will win.
Here are the number of games each person missed this week.

1158,"RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  The NYISO is delaying issuance of the November & December 1999 - 2nd Settlement Adjustments, scheduled for September 7th, by a week.
The delay is necessary to make corrections to the re-engineered invoicing process under which these settlements will be made.
Settlements for November 1999 through March 2000 were ""trued-up"" once under a process that only adjusted settlements at the hourly interval level.
Upon realizing that the now superseded process was deficient in its ability to ""true-up"" settlements at the SCD interval level, the process was completely re-engineered and put into operation in February 2001.
In order to perform the 2nd settlement adjustments [a.k.a.
true-ups] for November through March under the new process, the 1st true-ups of these months must be reversed to create the billing determinant measurement set that was used in the 1st true-up.
The newly acquired billing determinants for the 2nd settlement adjustments will then be netted against the set from the 1st true-ups.
That delta will then become the amount invoiced for the 2nd settlement adjustment.
This delay is to fix mapping problems observed between the old measurement set invoicing format and the new measurement set formats.
Invoices will be issued once the mapping problems have been corrected and we am satisfied that the settlements can be readily reconciled by our Market Participants.
The NYISO apologizes for this delay and any resultant problems.

1169,"This, from a Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.
America: The Good Neighbor.
Widespread but only partial news coverage was given recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from Toronto by Gordon Sinclair, a Canadian television commentator.
What follows is the full text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the Congressional Record:  ""This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the Americans as the most generous and possibly the least appreciated people on all the earth.
Germany, Japan and, to a lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of dollars and forgave other billions in debts.
None of these countries is today paying even the interest on its remaining debts to the United States.
When France was in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and swindled on the streets of Paris.
I was there.
I saw it.
When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United States that hurries in to help.
This spring, 59 American communities were flattened by tornadoes.
Nobody helped.
The Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of dollars!
into discouraged countries.
Now newspapers in those countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering Americans.
I'd like to see just one of those countries that is gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build its own airplane.
Does any other country in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star, or the Douglas DC10?
If so, why don't they fly them?
Why do all the International lines except Russia fly American Planes?
Why does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or woman on the moon?
You talk about Japanese technocracy, and you get radios.
You talk about German technocracy, and you get automobiles.
You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on the moon -!
not once, but several times - and safely home again.
You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right in the store window for everybody to look at.
Even their draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded.
They are here on our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at home to spend here.
When the railways of France, Germany and India were breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt them.
When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose.
Both are still broke.
I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the help of other people in trouble.
Can you name me even one time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble?
I don't think there was outside help even during the San Francisco earthquake.
Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around.
They will come out of this thing with their flag high.
And when they do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that are gloating over their present troubles.
I hope Canada is not one of those.""
Stand proud, America!
This is one of the best editorials that I have ever read regarding the United States.
It is nice that one man realizes it.
I only wish that the rest of the world would realize it.
We are always blamed for everything, and never even get a thank you for the things we do.
I would hope that each of you would send this to as many people as you can and emphasize that they should send it to as many of their friends until this letter is sent to every person on the web.
I am just a single American that has read this.

1170,"The invoices for November 1999 settlement adjustments will be posted by 23:00 today, Monday, September 17, 2001.
The NYISO apologizes for any inconvenience resulting in the delay in posting these invoices.
Transmission  Customers  will  observe adjustments to their settlements to: (1)  recover  costs  related  to  adjustments  made  outside of the billing process;  and  (2)  adjust  the  NYISO clearing account balance to zero for November 1999 settlements.
With  regard  to the adjustments made outside of the billing process, these adjustments  could not have been corrected by a billing code or determinant data fix.
As a result, the mechanism of paying and funding the adjustments is  done  through  adjustments  outside  of the billing process.
The total adjustment of $14,178.39 was allocated across 5,059,790 MWh.
Customers may validate  their  respective  adjustments by computing their ratio shares of the  $14,178.39  using 5,059,790 MWh as the denominator in their respective ratios of their November 1999 load.
Customers will observe a difference in the  denominators  used  in  the  ratio share allocation of this adjustment versus  adjustment  #2.
This  is  due  to  the  fact  that  the costs for adjustment  #1 are not allocated to those that received payment through the adjustment, which would defeat the purpose of the adjustment.
Prior  to  October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue   received  from  Schedule  1  charges,  which  were  comprised  of forecasted  uplift  & residual adjustments, and the costs actually incurred by  adjusting  subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000,  the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that  allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In  order  to  allow  any  changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled  through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an  over-collection  which  is  being  returned  to  Customers  through  an adjustment  to  their  monthly  balances.
This  billing treatment for the November  1999  settlement  adjustments  resulted  in credits to the market totaling  $5,583,559.78  allocated  across  5,074,229 MWh.
Customers where allocated  their  portion  of  this  adjustment based upon their respective ratio  shares of the 5,074,229 MWh of NYISO transmission service billed for the month.
November  1999  settlement adjustment settlement dates have been changed to address  the  delay  in  invoicing.
Payments due to the NYISO for November 1999  settlement  adjustments  are due to be received in the NYISO clearing account on Monday, September 24, 2001.
Payments due to market participants will  be  made  on  Thursday,  September  27,  2001.
Please  refer to the attachment below for banking instructions.
The  NYISO anticipates that the 2nd settlement adjustment for December 1999 settlements  will  be  invoiced tomorrow, Tuesday, September 2001 by 23:00.
Settlements  dates will be adjusted to accomodate the invoice date changes.
Given  the aforementioned schedules, payments due to the NYISO for December 1999  settlement  adjustments  will  be  due  to  be  received in the NYISO clearing  account  on  Tuesday, September 25, 2001.
Payments due to market participants  will  be  made on Friday, September 28, 2001.
The NYISO will confirm the invoicing schedule for December 1999 settlements tomorrow.

1195,"FCiani@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants,  One of the Generation Issues objectives deployed in September was to allow off-dispatch units to move in response to price signals.
A settlement feature of this change was that off-dispatch units would not receive bid production cost guarantees for incremental energy.
These units would only be guaranteed cost recovery for minimum generation and start-up costs.
The function to limit this cost recovery was incorrectly designed, with the result that the cost recovery was not limited to the bid minimum generation cost.
The cost recovery was incorrectly calculated as the bid minimum generation MW  times the bid minimum generation cost.
This error has been corrected and will be reflected in the next execution of the September settlement statements, which will correct the values before the September invoicing period.

Other Changes  ISOSu is the prefix for sales or purchases that occurred as a result of NYISO transactions during the supplemental process.
The supplemental process is implemented when there is insufficient UCAP available within a location and the NYISO must purchase UCAP from outside the location where the shortage has occurred to meet the NYCA reliability requirements.
PTID numbers to be used when identifying UCAP purchased through the NYISO auction have been assigned.
The PTID numbers range from 1 to 38 and are related to auctions or the supplemental processes.
For example, a participant who is selling UCAP that was previously purchased in the summer strip auction would enter PTID number 1 on the Offer form when selling into a subsequent ISO auction.
A list of PTID numbers is now available on the instruction page of the auction Offer forms.
Reminder  When identifying an ISO auction, please remember that you must think in terms of the procurement period for the first auction month when the transaction took place.
For example, on May 15 (the auction for the upcoming months of June through October) 3MW were transacted for the months of June and August.
The auction reference that you will use for both the June and August transactions are ISOMoJun.
The same auction reference would be used if on May 15, the transactions were for August and September.
When completing the Certification Form, do not net transactions.
Lets say that you are awarded 25 MW from the Strip Auction and later move (purchase or sell) 5 MW through a bilateral.
Your entries on the form would show the 25 MW strip auction transaction on one line and your second line would show the 5 MW bilateral transaction.
You can not use a value of 20MW on one line.
Each and Every Month you must submit your certification form.

It also states that LSEs will be notified of the final Unforced Capacity requirements (""UCR"") for the upcoming Obligation Procurement Period.
Neither statement is correct and a revised Timeline is available for comment.
It will be discussed and finalized at the next ICAP Working Group Meeting on October 5.
After that October 5 meeting, the updated and corrected Timeline will be posted for approval at the October 25 BIC Meeting.
Providing firm final ICAP Supplier UCAP values or LSE UCRs was never feasible in this timeframe.
Preliminary LSE UCRs for November were provided to all LSEs on September 21.
Final LSE UCRs will be provided on October 9.
ICAP Suppliers can estimate their UCAP value based information already supplied.
All ICAP Suppliers will have a firm UCAP value for November prior to October 9, if there are no problems with the data submitted and in time to participate in the Monthly Auction to be conducted on October 11.
In the meantime, Suppliers can offer as much or as little UCAP for the Winter Capability Period strip auction as they expect to have available, recognizing that their EFORd values will be updated monthly during the Capability Period.
Recognize also that there will continue to be Monthly and Deficiency auctions conducted each month during the Capability Period, allowing any Supplier or LSE to clear any long or short postions.

Once upon a time, when business rules and bidding rules were changing faster then tires on pit row, it was agreed to limit the entries to 14 days in order to avoid having long term deals fail (as per nameless NYISO guy).
Now that things have slowed down and bidders are more savvy and able to babysit their bids, we should be looking to expand the time frame for placing longer term bids in MIS.
An  informed NYISO guy (different guy by the way) said it would be easy and using 4-5 man days to do.
I have talked to Ray Kinney (Chair of the S&P WG) and gave him the same song.

College games were overall better than the pros this week.
No one correctly picked the Clemson victory over Georgia Tech.
Also no one picked New England over Indy, Cleveland over Jacksonville or Baltimore over Denver.

Rick picked San Francisco tonight with 37 total points scored, Rob picked San Fran with 41 points and Todd picked the Jets with 52 total points.
Therefore, it will first come down to who wins the game tonight, as if the Jets win, Todd will win it outright.
If the 49ers win, then it will come down to total points.
If there is 40 or more points scored, Rob will win, 38 or less, Rick will win, 39 there will be a tie.

1215,"market_relations@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Dear Market Participants:  On the November 1999 & December 1999 Transmission Customer Monthly Statements many customers have noted under the ""Energy Settlement"" section for ""Forward Energy"" a change in MW-Hrs with no associated change in dollar amounts.
This is because of a correction in the sign convention for the MW-Hrs related to external generation transactions (transactions from a proxy bus to the NYISO reference bus).
For all other types of transactions the NYISO charges customers the appropriate TUC or LBMP  based on the MWs that flowed, but for external generation transactions, customers receive payments from the NYISO, and therefore these types of transactions have an opposite sign convention.
The dollars associated with the external generation transactions have always had the proper sign convention, but the MW-Hrs have not.
On 01/17/2000 this sign convention was corrected for all billing months going forward resulting in the correct MW-Hr values being reported from February 2000 to date.
However, November 1999 - January 2000 did not have the proper MW-Hrs reported on the Transmission Customer Monthly Statements.
With the latest settlement adjustments posted the MW-Hrs are being corrected with the proper sign convention.
Transmission Customers will see similar changes in their forward energy MW-Hrs for January 2000's settlement adjustment.

The Texas A&M/Colorado game was missed by a fair amount of people as well.
In the pros, quite a few people picked Baltimore to beat Green Bay, but Green Bay won; also Kansas City was picked by some people to beat Pittsburgh, however, the Steelers won; San Diego was picked by many people to beat the Patriots, however, New England won again; the Miami/Jets and Denver/Seattle games were missed by most people and even the Oakland/Indy game was commonly missed as well.
Through all that, I managed to get only 7 games wrong; Stanford, Kansas St, Florida, San Diego, Miami, Denver and Indianapolis.
I am in the lead currently with 7 missed games with Dallas tonight, while 2 people missed 8 games with Washington tonight.

I picked 31 total points, Steve picked 35 and Daniel 37.
Therefore, I will win with 32 or fewer pts scored, Steve and I will split with Washington and 33 pts.

1249,"Hello Everyone,  	Well, this week was no doubt a tough week for us all picking the winners.
Approximately 10 of the NFL games were won by the underdogs this week.
Many people missed the Pittsburgh/Tampa Bay game, also the Carolina/Washington game, Baltimore/Cleveland, New England/Indy game; Atlanta/New Orleans, Denver/San Diego and Green Bay/Minnesota game.
Back on Thursday, Buffalo was only picked by one person over Jacksonville.
In the college games, just about everyone missed the North Carolina/Clemson game, while the Wisconsin/Illinois and USC/Notre Dame games were missed by about half the people.
Through all that, Larry Campbell is the current leader with only 7 wrong, while George Phillips is the only other person still in contention with 8 wrong.
Larry picked the Giants tonight with 39 total pts, while George picked the Eagles with 32 total points.
Therefore, if the Giants win, Larry will win outright, if the Eagles win and there is 36 or more total pts, then Larry will also win.
George will win with a Philly victory and 35 or fewer total points scored.
There were 31 entries this week, therefore the prize is $62.
There is another Thursday night NFL game this week, therefore we will make this week's picks due Thursday afternoon.
I did have a few requests for making each entry $3 this week, to increase the money you could win.
Therefore, please email me back if you would like to see the entry fee at $3 instead of $2.
If we get more than 20 people who would not mind a $1 increase in the entry fee for a bigger prize, then we will go with it.
I do not want to go more than $3 for now.
Therefore, if we can keep the 30-35 people each week, the prize will be closer to $100, instead of $60-70 dollars.
This is not my idea to have some people give up more money, but just a suggestion I got from a few people.
Below are the number of games missed by each person this week.

1252,"RBowers@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  Upon review of August 25, 2001 advisory billing statements you will observe significant balances for Transmission Customer Ancillary Services: Residual Adjustments.
This is due to the NYISO not receiving a file from ConEd that contains their sub-zonal load data.
When this file is not received for use in the billing process, the billing system sees the ConEd subzones with NO load in real time.
This causes all DAM LSE purchases and scheduled transaction energy with ConEd points of withdrawal to be sold back to the market in real time.

The Commission ordered NYISO to narrow the scope of the TEP, and to file tariff sheets doing so within 30 days.
NYISO proposed virtual bidding procedures (ER01-3009; ER01-3153):  Tariff changes to implement virtual bidding were approved.
The changes would allow market participants to bid non-physical generation and load into the day-ahead market and settle the bids in the real-time market.
Also accepted were NYISOs Market Mitigation Measures to address gaming or market power strategies that might emerge as a result of the virtual bidding.
NYISO - Cost responsibility for new interconnections.
(ER01-2967):  Tariff changes allocating cost responsibility for interconnection facilities.
The provisions allocate to developers 100% of the cost of facilities necessary to physically interconnect the project.
Additionally, developers are allocated the coswts for transmission system upgrades that would not have been made ""but for"" the interconnection, minus the cost of any facilities that the NYISO's regional plan dictates would have been necessary anyway for load growth and reliability purposes.
ISO-NE - Interim Bid Caps (ER01-3086):  Commission approved extension of bid caps until the Northeastern RTO is operational.
Calpine v. ISO-NE (EL01-124):  Commission granted complaint by Calpine and Mirant, finding that ISO-NE has amended Market Rule 5 to exclude external contracts from setting the energy clearing price, in violation of a Commission order.

1260,"Attention: Houston-based Outlook Users The Global Messaging Team is proud to announce that beginning today, Monday July 16th, Houston-based Enron employees that have been migrated to Outlook will be able to securely access their Enron Email from anywhere on the web.
This means that if you can get on to the Internet, you can access your Enron Email with Outlook Web Access (OWA) without having to dial in to Enron's network.
Please note that this is not available to those users still on Lotus Notes but will be available once they are migrated to Outlook.
Once on the Internet, type mail.enron.com in your browser address window and supply your Enron network logon credentials as username and password.
For example: Username: jdoe4 Password: ******** Once you log in, Outlook Web Access opens your Enron Email mailbox.
Outlook Web Access (OWA) allows you to send and receive mail, perform calendar tasks and manage your mail and contacts, as well as access your mailbox folders.
At this time, Public Folders are not accessible via OWA.
Please keep in mind that Outlook Web Access is a browser-based version of what you might use in the office, so the functionality may be slightly different and some features of Outlook 2000 may not be available at all.
Additionally, OWA is only supported using Internet Explorer 5.x only and not supported with Netscape.
Outlook Web Access is the standard Email package for connecting to your Enron mail from home, whether you are using an Enron-issued home PC, an Internet connection with your personal home PC, or your ClickAtHome PC.
We will not support the use of the full Outlook installation for home use.
Outlook Web Access for remote locations and European/APAC Enron sites is currently being addressed and will be available soon.
At this time, OWA is only available if your mailbox resides on a Houston mail server.
If you have any questions, please call:  Resolution Center at x31411 or 	ETS Solutions Center at x54745

The Generation Supplier Issues development project will be completed with the following functionality being introduced into the NYISO markets (Please see published Technical Bulletins for full descriptions):     Units will be able to operate as Energy Limited    Resources (ELR).
Qualifying units whose schedules    are modified will not be subjected to any financial    harm from the obligation to cover energy balancing    charges.
Units will be able to operate as Capacity Limited    Resources (CLR).
Bid rules will be modified to allow    units to indicate an upper MW limit, separate from    the Upper Operating Limit (UOL), that will be honored    in the scheduling horizon by SCUC, BME and SCD under    certain environmental and operating situations.
Multiple response rates will be allowed.
This modification    is intended to encourage units to be on dispatch by    allowing units to move in response to price signals.
MIS    will be modified to allow up to three response rate ranges    to be entered as static data inputs.
Payment rules for start-up will be modified.
Payment rules for unforced energy replacement will be    modified.
Changes to SCUC will be deployed to optimize Phase Angle Regulators (PARs) for evaluation of the Day Ahead Market (DAM).

First, thank you to the ISO for updating the HAM prices.
Second - I have a question regarding dispatch.
I notice now that HAM prices in NY City are in excess of $1,000.
Which to me, given a bid cap, implies that everything capable of running will be dispatched.
Yet, when I look at the dispatcher notices, I see that both the Gowanus and Astoria CT blocks are running out of merit for the ISO (note - not local security).
How can this be - certainly the HAM prices indicate these units should be running for economics and setting price.
I hope we are not going to see the cost of these units in our uplift charges.

However, the threshold for approval for employee meetings and events has been lowered to $500, and some additional requirements must be met prior to approval.
Please be sure to follow the procedures described below for all meetings and events, so we can continue to successfully manage these events.
1) Prior to making any commitments to customers or vendors, all customer events with anticipated costs in excess of $5,000, and all employee events with anticipated costs in excess of $500 must be reviewed by the Enron Americas Public Relations department and approved by the Enron Americas Office of the Chairman 2) The PR department will handle the site search and hotel contract negotiations for all such events.
Once this is completed, the PR department will work with you to plan and produce your event in its entirety; or they can provide as much or as little assistance as you require.
The PR department will be responsible for helping you achieve the best value for your program and EA.
3) A completed expenditure request form (see attached) and supporting documentation is required for each event.
Employee meetings require a detailed agenda as part of the event documentation prior to approval.
Please submit the completed expenditure request form and documentation to the PR department at EB 3642, or work with PR department employees to complete the form.
4) After PR review, the expenditure will be submitted to the EA Office of the Chairman for final approval.

1302,"scheije@selectenergy.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:  I apologize for the larger circulation of this email than to just the S&P WG.
The MC last week urged a rapid consideration of the interactions between BME and SCD and their related prices from the hot, high load days of July 24 and 25.
To pursue this there is additional information needed from the ISO.
Below is a preliminary list I compiled that would be useful in assessing the situation.
Data should be provided for relevant hours i.e.
those with high BME or RT prices or both.
Particularly for those hours with binding reserve constraints in HA or RT.
1 RT reserve levels in each hour (it is recognized that the value fluctuates but the the point is to get an idea of apporximately how short the ISO was of reserves, if at all)  2 Similar information should be obtained for our neighbors; PJM, NE and IMO.
Also, could the ISO describe what the others do hour ahead to prepare for the next operating hour under circumstances such as we encountered those two days?
NY has the unfortunate position of producing prices related to decisions for which it pays otherwise - what were our neighbors doing?
3 An accounting, by hour, of reserves carried on exports out of NY  4 Identification of any non-ICAP based exports that may have been counted for reserve; this shouldn't happen as it puts non-ICAP providers in the position of being recalled...  5 BME reserve deficiencies by hour; were the reserve levels always met, albeit at extreme prices, or was the ISO unable to cover the requirements in advance?
6 Based on Mike Calimano's report, there were ""a couple hundred Mws"" of operating units not seen by BME; this situation needs to be (1) confirmed and (2) explained and corrected  The following are sort of 2nd tier questions:  1 If the ISO was short of reserves in RT why weren't the EDRP resources, who were notified, not called into play to aid in curing the deficiency?
There should have been no economic judgement call by operators (if the first two hours were at $500 that was likely cheaper than what BME was taking in if the BME prices applied to settlement under ECA B).
BME made no judgement call when its prices spiked due to the 30 M NSR scarcity and took available imports.
2 What would have been the System State(s) if the reserve margins had been held in RT (assuming ISO was short in RT)?
Would this have forced a Major Emergency and subsequent voltage reductions, public appeals etc?
Had this been done would have the EDRP Mws been activated?
I would also like to offer the following as potential changes to be considered.
They are based on the limited discussions that have taken place so far.
1 Include exports that are being counted as reserve in BME as it evaluates its reserve position.
Since BME is deciding which transactions will be scheduled, operators would need to indicate which transactions and how many Mws could be counted in RT as reserves.
The implications for the solution algorithm are unclear - can BME recognize the additional reserves thus carried?
Would it result in fewer imports and lower BME prices?
What if the reserve requirements used as input to BME were manipulated downward for reserves on exports?
What happens if BME did not schedule the export(s)?
2 Subject to the ISO providing detailed RT reserve info, it seems that the reserves should be carried in RT and that SCD should not be allowed to dispatch with units that were not available to BME (thus resulting in the large price disparities).
If the ISO had adequate reserves in RT, SCD should not be allowed to produce RT price reductions relative to what BME is doing.
However, having said this, if there are no energy resources to maintain reserve levels AND the ISO needs to maintain its regulation room, the next thing to go is load.
To my long understanding, we do not shed load to avoid shedding load (at least not to maintain reserves...)  Perhaps if BME has some adjustments and the missing Mws are accounted for, little needs to be done in RT.
(This does not mean that SCD handles GTs correctly - that is still a commit problem it is incapable of resolving...)  3 At one point, we had approved use of BME prices to settle all HA transactions.
This approach was scuttled by the ISO when they discovered that there were persistent, unidirectional price differences between the proxy busses and their connected in-NY zones.
We then retreated to automating what is done under ECA B; substituting BME prices only under constrained ramp or ATC conditions.
The ISO should review this again.
Does the price difference remain, inviting gaming?
If so, is there a way for the MMU to watch for or prevent inappropriate opportunistic behavior?
A full, partial 3rd settlement would lessen the sting of HA prices that are out of synch with RT.
4 The ISO should review the multipliers in the LP solution that insure that energy, then regulation and then the 3 types of reserve are maintained.
They should be no more than required for a proper solution outcome.
Prices at $65000 are not necessary and misleading (while mathematically correct...).
Also, if we are to consider settling transactions at BME prices, such an outcome would result in considerable opposition...  5 Another non-controversial change would be to extend the DADRP participants to hour ahead evaluation.
In the instant circumstance, it is likely that BME would have chosen some of those loads opposed to imports (there was no congestion so some of those western loads might have looked pretty good...).
Since there is the issue that the DADRP is subsidized, I would propose that, if extended to BME, that the DA bids be used for BME evaluation.
If nothing else look at it as sending money to companies in NYS.

Transmission Customers will observe the following adjustments to their settlements.
Adjustments have been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the billing process and to adjust the NYISO clearing account balance to zero for each month invoiced.
Prior to October 2000, the NYISO recovered or refunded differences in the revenue received from Schedule 1 charges, which were comprised of forecasted uplift & residual adjustments, and  the costs actually incurred by adjusting subsequent month's Schedule 1 rates accordingly.
In October 2000, the NYISO implemented a change in the tariffed Schedule 1 provisions that allowed the recovery and refund of these costs as they were incurred.
In order to allow any changes in uplift and residual adjustments to be settled through the settlement adjustment process, the code implemented in October 2000 was used to report these costs to the market.
This results in an over-collection which is being returned to Customers through an adjustment to their monthly balances.
This billing treatment for July 2000 and August 2000 settlement adjustments resulted in credits to the market totaling $7,700,605.23 and $32,146,310.55, respectively.
Customers where paid their share of these adjustments based upon their respective ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.
This adjustment provides for the settlement of all accounts in the market in the month(s) the costs or over-collections were realized and adjusts the NYISO clearing account balance impact to zero for each month.
Adjustments have also been made to Transmission Customers' invoices to recover the costs related adjustments made to customer settlements outside of the billing process.
These adjustments totalled $964,548.42 for March 2001, $375,110.49 for July 2000 and $48,973.41 for August 2000.
Customers where allocated their share in these costs based upon their respective ratio shares of NYISO load for each month.

Understand  these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to  emit.
When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required,  so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA  approved document.
This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers  presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net  more emissions, if needed.
Emissions are presented for a single engine only  in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility  except Sta.

I had sent to him the USGS quad sheets of the C/S  sites for review.
Today he stated that he didnt think surveys would be  needed at either location due to the fact that there had been historic  disturbance at each location and that there was no sensitive habitiats in or  near the C/S sites which would warrant surveys.
However, because of the  issue of tribal lands, he was going to discuss this issue with the Navajo  Nation director and verify his opinion and he would let Transwestern know on  Monday of next week as to what the Tribes final decision would be, but he was  almost sure that the Trib would recommend no surveys.

As mentioned in the last note, SWG has  discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into  their system.
SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and  independent interconnects.
Liquids have been collected at the two  interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm,  respectively.
They have taken approx.
100 wipe samples and have had ""hits""  but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.
In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the  installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.
They felt  that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of  PCBs into their system.
Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be  sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two  interconnect locations.

1343,"Randy, this is a short summary of the environmental findings that were  identified during the records review conducted at the Corpus Christi Koch  facility offices on May 1st and 2nd of this year.
All environmental records which were available in the file data room at the  Koch office  were reviewed.
Assumptions were made that the environmental  records were complete for all assets included in the sale.
Primary emphasis  was placed on those environmental issues which are normally associated with a  sale or purchase of assets dealing with distribution and transmission of  crude oil.
In particular, pipeline and tank farms were the most critical  assets which were reviewed.
Based upon the data review, the Koch assets were in compliance with the  following:    Air permitting, permit by rule, standard expemtions, recordkeeping and fee  payments were documented     NSPS recordkeeping and inspections for VOC control on large crude oil tanks  were documented     Oil Pollution Act-OPA 90 plans had been prepared and were up to date    SARA compliance and reporting had been completed    SPCC plans had been prepared for each site which qualified under 40 CFR 112    Spill reporting history and notifications to the state agency were  available for review     There are ongoing groundwater and soil remediation activities at one site  included in the asset for sale      (permits for the remediation activity is in place)    Hazardous waste notifications, annual reportings and fee payments were  documented  Based upon the above review, there were no issues which could be identified  which would be condsidered a major environmental limitation or would be a  considered a major environmental  liability.
This statement is again based  upon the assumption that all environmental information was present in the  data room for the assets in question.
It should also be stated that this  analysis of Koch's environmental compliance is based upon the fact that Koch  has not held back or provided false or misleading information or knowledge  during their presentation or informaiton contained in the facility files.
Pending further development and interest of this potential purchase, a  recommendation is made to conduct a phase I due diligence and site visit to  each location to verify findings from the records review.
Also, due to the  past history of Koch's operating practices, it is recommended that contract  conditions be implicitly stated that EOTT will not be held liable for  discoveries of past deficiencies or releases of contamination which have  occurred on any of the Koch assets purchased.

area lead       total petroleum hydrocarbons     chromates   Cooling tower area- chromates   Compressor area- BTEX     chromates     lead  In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only  conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.
I am not comfortable with basing  decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the  fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move  vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.
This  is indeed the case for chromates.
I based my recommendations for metal  concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels  for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground  storage tank guidlines for California.
There were references to a 1989  document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have  been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and  therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states  for total petroleum hydrocarbons.
Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or  the loading rack issues.
One last issue.
As you know, identification of contamination is usually  accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of  processes and or history.
Report results of the surface contamination do not  show there to be an immediate environmental concern.
Due to the age of the  facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were  conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented  in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the  facility.

","Weekly Activity Report, Roswell Area"
1360,"I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to  submit an emissions inventory for 2000.
This notification from the agency  originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.
I called the  TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the  emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.
Because VOC's are  the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999  inventory.
Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50  tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.
We discussed why EOTT would  submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.
The  only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an  increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this  facility was shown as a title V source.
According to the phone records from  the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that  the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.
I  have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed  for this facility in the near future.
In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if  there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit  on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with  previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that  this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10  (emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed  from the TNRCC mailings.
Should EOTT confirm the status of operating  throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make  written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

She  was very cordial and appreciative concerning Transwestern's proactive efforts  to contact not only her office but all federal and state agencies  which may  have jurisdictional lands impacted by the project.
Although the proposed  route of the pipeline corridor has not been firmly established, she did   offer some general, yet valuable information concerning the geographic area  which exists south of Flagstaff into roughly northern Phoenix.
The area south of Flagstaff into Phoenix crosses of three major ecological  regions identified by the TNC with major biological diversity of plants and  animals.
The TNC has completed published studies on two of the regions.
The  TNC has requested that should this project be apporved, these publications be  used to assist in the environmental studies which will need to be completed  prior to construction and approval by FERC.
To the south and east of  Flagstaff is a sensitive portfolio consisting of the Verde River which is of  ecologic interest due to the abundance of endangered fish and bird species  which live in and around the area of the River.
This river could be  impacted by the pipeline due to its meandering in a southwesterly direction  across Arizona.
I have contacted other state and federal governmental agencies, in addition  to the TNC, and all parties have expressed difficulity in assessing the  environmental impact of a project of this magnitude without knowing the  pipeline corridor route.
Part of this concern is due to the extensive and  unique biological diversity of Arizona.

1375,"With respect to the September 13, 1999 letter from Richard and Oreane Garcia  concerning pipeline integrity  and noise issues, Transwestern Pipeline  Company offers the following response:  Pipeline Integrity.
With the construction of the evaporation ponds over  Transwestern's right of way and pipline, Transwestern has closely monitored  the potential for  impacts for the pipeline.
This includes a more frequent  inspection of the pipeline conditions underlying the ponds by taking  potentiometric readings to verify that  corrosion is not present.
Transwestern has also installed rectifiers to assist in eleminating the  potential of pipeline corrosion.
As a DOT requirement, Transwestern has  cathodically protected the entire pipeline system with an external pipeline  coating to further ensure the integrity of the pipeline underlying the  evaporation ponds.
The pipline safety  measures implemented by Transwestern  are designed to not only identify corrosion iimpacts to the pipeline system  at   the inception of detrimental impacts as a result of corrosion, but also  allow for long term stability and integrity  by conducting state of the art  monitoring and detection.
Noise Issue.
In the initial environmental assessment and study, Transwestern  conducted baseline surveys of the area to determine existing noise levels.
This study was completed to assist Transwestern in the mitigation measures  which will be implemented after construction of the Gallup Compresso  Station.
Pending completion of the facility, Transwestern will conduct post  noise studys to determine whether facility noise levels have increased above  those levels mandated by FERC.
In the event of operational noise levels  exceeding the FERC regulatory level of 55 ldn, Transwestern is committed to  performing any and all  mitigation measures necessary to ensure that the post  noise level of the facility will not be above the level mandated by FERC.
Decrepancy of trailer park residents.
In the letter by Mr. Garcia, it was  stated that Transwestern's assessment of the number of residences in the  adjacent trailer park  was not 18 as had been stated in our original study,  but ""more like 35 trailers"".
The number of mobile home residences currrently  in the trailer park may in fact be closer to 35.
Transwestern's trailer park  residence count was taken in the winter of the year when the fluctuating job  market is normally down and the number of residences in the park was low.
The transient nature of mobile home residences and the fluctuating job  economy of the area is probably a direct reflection of the up and down nature  of the residences.
It should also be noted that during the time that the  trailer park count was made, the owner of the trailer park who is also the  operator of the evaporation ponds was experiencing major difficulties in the  operation of the  ponds and raw sewage  had overflowed the pond embankments  and  had resulted in the raw sewage ponding in the yards of many of the  trailer park residents.
It was actually noted that many of the spaces  normally occupied by mobile homes had been vacated.
This unsanitary  condition was also identified by the New Mexico Environment Department.
The  NMED had implemented enforcement actions against the trailer park owner.

They strongly  suggested that I contact the compliance group before contacting Nancy Wrona,  Director of the ADEQ.
I left a message with the supervisor of the ADEQ  compliance section, Kathy McConnell (?)
602-207-2328, but have not heard back  from her.
Either Bill Kendrick or I will  be touching base with her again,  tomorrow.
Arnold has given me the following list of construction items he would like to  have the ADEQ grant us permission/waiver to do in leau of receiving the air  permits:   all earthwork  trench construction and piping tie ins  all foundation and building construction  installation of ancillary equipment  This list is probably too aggressive and falls out of what the agency may  allow us to do.

1377,"Dan, sorry about taking so long it getting back to you about this, but I had  a couple of crises I had to address,  Im still realing from the impact.
I  have attached for your review the agreement which we are in the process of  finalizing with the Wild Turkey Federation.
Take a look at the document and  let me know what you think.
After your review we can make the necessary  changes and modifications.
I have been advised by our legal department that  each of the three major pipelines owned and operated by Enron will need a  separate contract, with the RMEF, so what we decide for Transwestern, will  undoubtably work for the others.
Thanks for your patience in this.
",See what you think
1378,"Jon and Ruth, presented below are the comments to the air perimts at 3 and  4.
Please review for clairty and content.
I have spoken to Roger Kohn about  all of these issues and the only one which may be a problem is with No.
2.
He is checking on what the EPA can do about this.
I have spoken to Arnold  Eisenstein about what we can do with the strict 25 ppmvd requriement for NOx  and CO and he has said that we can hold to the 25 ppm value by doing some  major gas recycling.
This is a fuel waste and costly.
Anyway, depending  upon how long this issue delays the issuance of the permit will undoubtably  determine whether we give in to the 25 ppmvd or hold out for 40 ppmvd.
Id  like your comments asap.
1.
The responsible official name change to  Danny Pribble.
2..
The draft permit limits NOx and CO emissions to  25 ppmv at 15% O2, based on a 3-hour average, except during periods of  startup   and shutdown.
At 60F and above the GE data indicates that these  rates are achievable under all operating conditions.
However, GE   data  indicates that NOx and CO may be as high as 40 ppmv during low-load  conditions of 60%and lower.
The permit application represented turbine operations at base load 80% of  the time with reduced load operations (64% load) occurring  no more than 20%  of the time.
The potential to emit calculations presented the emissions in  the application in units of lb.hr and ton/yr.
These values were accepted by  the EPA for the netting analysis, and  took were taken into account by the  EPA (See EPA Statement  of Basis document).
Because the permit conditions  hold us to ppmvd values and not lb/yr or ton/year values, Transwestern is    concerned that under low load conditions of less than 60%, the emissions of  NOx and CO would be 40 ppmvd.
Transwestern is  requesting that  a provision  be made in the permit conditions that  emissions of NOx and CO be held to 40  ppmvd during the 20 % of  the time that the turbines operating conditions is  less than or equal to 60%.
3.
The word ""Catepillar"" is mispelled throughout the permit.
4.
Permit conditions for sulfur testing in the fuel gas requires Transwestern  to use methodologies (wet chemistry technology) that are not     normally  used to monitor and measure sulfur in the natural gas.
Transwestern has  received approval from the EPA for other custom  fuel monitoring schedules to  use  ""GPA Standard 2377"" (length of stain tube) or gas chromatography as the  proposed methodology  to  monitor sulfur in the natural gas.
",Staions 3 and 4 air permit comments to EPA
1379,"Transwestern Pipeline Company  Transwestern has run into some problems with the air permit conditions for  the Redrock Expansion.
For the state permits, the ADEQ wants to abitrarily  set a 10% safety factor to the emissions levels which approach PSD.
This  means that they have written into the draft permit a reduction in the  allowable hours of operation for  the generator from 8760 to 7800.
This  generator is the facility's prime source of power and therefore, needs to be  operated for 8760 hours.
Transwestern will challenge the agency's authority  to apply a 10%safety factor.
For the Indain lands permits, the EPA has written a permit condition of 25  ppmvd for NOx and CO under all operating conditions.
Manufacturerers  guarantees only apply at 25 ppmvd at loads above 65% and at 0F.
It appears  that Transwestern may have convenienced the EPA to back away from permit  limits in ppmvd and include as permit conditons lb/hr and ton/yr emissions  limits that Transwestern originally placed into its applications.
Northern Natural Gas Company  A standard exemption for the NNG Martin Co. No.
1 facility was submitted to  the TNRCC.
Preliminary maintenance activities and newly published AP-42  emissions factors have shown that the Martin Co. 1 facility may be a Title V  facility.
Under the old AP-42 factors, the units at the facility were not  greater than 100 ton/year sources.
Continued investigation  is being  conducted to determine emissions levels from the units at the facility.
EOTT A request and supporting documentation was submitted to the TNRCC to remove  the EOTT Crane facility from the Title V operating permit program.
New data  on the crude oil received into the facility shows the emissions limits for  VOCs to be less than the Title V regulated limit.
General  Preparations are being  finalized for the environmental roundtable to be held  next week in Albuquerque.

1381,"Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on  the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.
Wipe tests taken of the  interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results  of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.
This was not a standard wipe taken of a  specific area.
These wipes were taken over large areas to determine  presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.
After the cleaning operation  was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the  separator.
All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.
I feel  we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.

1382,"Bill as per your request, presented below is a status of the air permitting  activity by the agencies as of today 11/01/01.
Stations 1 and 2.
The EPA has completed is review of these state permits and  has sent them back to the ADEQ for comment.
I have spoken to Shudeish, the  permit engineer for the ADEQ, and he is reviewing EPA's comments as this e  mail is being written.
He will give me a call when his review is complete,  but he does not anticipate any major issues which cant be resolved prior to  the public hearing.
These permits went out for public notice on October 15  and 16, which means that the comment period ends on Nov. 15 and 16.
The ADEQ  plans on holding the public hearing for both permits on monday Nov. 19 in  Williams AZ.
at 7:00 pm.
I plan on being there.
Williams is located approx.
30 miles west of Flagstaff, AZ.
The address for the hearing is the Council  Chambers located at 113 south 1st street.
So far, there have been no  responses submitted to the ADEQ by the public.
In EPA's review process,  they  had a problem with methodology proposed by Transwestern for measuring  sulfur in the fuel gas.
We had proposed stain tubes in the custom fuel  monitoring schedule, they wanted us to do wet chemistry.
We convinced them  otherwise (Byron, because of this, you wont need to order a sulfur analyzer  for the Needles facility.
This should save you about $40K).
There was also  an issue with manufacturers quarantees regarding particulate matter emissions  from the turbine and catepillar.
This has been resolved also.
Stations 3 and 4.
I received a call from Roger Kohn, the permit engineer for  the EPA.
He is satisified with the permit application contents and has also  approved stain tubes for the sulfur measurement at these locations.
There  are no outstanding issues on these permits from the EPA.
The public comment  period for the Station 3 and 4 permits ends Nov.  3.
After this date, it  will take 1-2 weeks for the Regional Administrator of the EPA to sign off on  the permits  and then he will have them issued to Transwestern.
As of this  date, there have been no comments submitted to the EPA for the permits for  station 3 and or 4.

1385,"This is just a short update on the conference call just completed with  Michael Adewumi of Penn State, concerning the PCB pipeline modeling project  proposed for the Transwestern mainline system.
David Roensch, Dr. Adewumi  and myself discussed the latest proposal submitted by Adewumi and based upon  his answers to the technical and operational questions, it appears that the  model will yeild some useful information.
Adewumi was asked about the  simultaneous modeling of PCB's and arsenic and feels that the model can  address this situation.
He felt that by initiating the model to the pipeline  segement  selected for the study (between C/S 4 and C/S3) this information  could be projected to the other pipeline segments with physical and  elevational conditions not represented in the segment selected.
As is the  case with most projects of this nature, answers to some questions cannot be  addressed until we begin the process.
It appears that the next step in this process is to have Mike Terraso contact  Michael Adewumi.
David Roensch and I will be available to feed technical and  operational information to Adewumi for his modeling input.
It may also be in  the best interest of this project  to see a team of technical and operational  experts from Enron and Transwestern begin a  brain stroming of this project  during the data input stage to address issues related to the field cleaning  trials, both of the pipeline system and the C/S piping.
By working through  the process, we may be able to alleviate some potential concerns  and  increase the cleaning success.
Although Transwestern has been involved in  this type of cleaning for a number of years, based upon the liquids data  results, the system has met with variable success.
The more technical and  operational information we can incorporate into the model, the better will be  the modeling conclusions and results of the  cleaning activity.

The meeting centered around three  issues:  a UST site which had been removed, but not formally closed, a  historic removal of asbestos which had been buried at the facility in the  late 1980's, and the ongoing groundwater remediation at  the site.
Transwestern provided a history of the above mentioned activiites and why  these issues were unresolved in the ""eyes"" of the Laguna.
Transwestern  committed to submitting closure requests for the UST and asbestos issues.
With repsect to the groundwater issue, a presentation was given enlighting  the Laguna representative of the difficult nature of the subsurface geology  and groundwater characteristics to rapidly clean the contaminants  (chlorinated solvents and PCB's) and Transwestern's intent to continue its  remediation efforts.
Transwestern assured the Laguna environmental  representative that all correspondance and data pertaining to environmental  issues would be submitted to the pueblo agency.
At the conclusion of the  meeting, the Laguna's understood Transwestern's commitment to maintaining the  policies and practices consistent with the pueblo of Laguna.
The meeting provided Transwestern and the Laguna's with the opportunity to  meet and share ideas and opinions and initiate working relationships.

1388,"For those teams that have turbines installed after 1990 and/or for those  turbines which have undergone power  unit changouts, the following  recordkeeping and monitoring conditions apply:  1) DAILY recordkeeping of nitrogen and sulfur must be taken of the fuel gas  which supplies the applicable turbine(s).
2) This recordkeeping consists of electronic recording (gas chromtograph for  nitrogen and  delmar or equivelant for sulfur) or stain tubes may also be  used  for sulfur.
These DAILY records include measurements on Saturdays and  Sundays.
3) The measurement must be taken at the location.
An exception to this is  that the nitrogen and sulfur measurements may be taken upstream or  downstream  of the applicable turbine facility provided that there are no  natural gas deliveries into the pipe which would interfere or dilute/increase  the measurements  for the applicable turbine fuel gas.
4) Fuel gas records in hard copy form or equivalent  for  the nitrogen and  sulfur must be maintained at the facility or at a central location for easy  retrival.
5) A turbine facility may waiver out of this nitorgen and sulfur daily  recordkeeping requirement by obtaining a custom fuel monitoring schedule  (CFMS) from  the EPA.

My question is, how does the fuel use compare  with what Solar says the fuel use should be?
If we can get Solar to provide  written guarantees and ""UP"" the fuel use value for the turbine, we can up the  fuel value on the permit.
The state of Colorado perceives increased fuel use  beyond manufacturers values as the turbine not operating correctly and in  need of mechanical adjustment.
From their eyes, this would be a strong  indication of excess emissions, and I think there evaluation would hold some  merit.
Anyway, I dont want to send up a red flag to the state of Colorado.
Would you contact Solar and compare their fuel use values with what the  monitors say the turbine is burning at La Plata?
Then let me know.

As a result of the  PG&E press release, SoCal management directed additional sampling to be done  at their interconnect with Transwestern and downstream of this interconnect.
Ralph reported that a number of liquid samples came back at around 7 ppm,  however one sample at their Kelso Station, near Barstow,  came back at 77  ppm.
Ralph had indicated that there has been an increase in the PCB's coming into  their collection locations in the Needles area as evidenced by the following:   Based upon 1997 data, almost no liquids greater than 50 ppm were revcovered   Data collected in 1998 showed that approx.
8% of the liquids were greater  than 50 ppm   Data collected in 1999 showed that approx.
9% of the liquids were greater  than 50 ppm  Based upon this, Ralph had stated that SoCal would be collecting additional  sampling information and possibly entering into an internal montoring  program, somewhat like PG&E is currently doing now.
I had informed Ralph that our Needles M/S facility had seen almost no liquids  in the last 5 years, other than a recent accumulation of a one time pigging  in early 2000 when a small volume of liquids (less than 55 gallons) had been  collected.
We discussed that the accumulations seen on the SoCal system  were probably from existing liquids on their system which had collected in  low points in their pipeline and were moving downstream due to the increased  flows from TW into SoCal.
Ralph gave the impression that there were no immediate management tensions  resulting from the recent ""hits"".

The proposed noise threshold will be 48.6 DBA(A).
There are no Transwestern facilities in the Farmington resource area which  will be impacted by this proposed level, however the potential exists for  several Transwestern locations in southeast New Mexico to be impacted.
A meeting was held with the president of Del Mar, concerning the issues  associated with the lead in their lead acetate tape for monitoring sulfur  concentrations in the natural gas.
A  request  was made to the company to  determine the feasability of recycling the tape and eleviate the management  and disposal issues associated with the tape as a hazardous waste.
The quarterly SoCal Transwestern PCB conference call was held this week.
Transwesten's share (86%) of SoCal's PCB management activities was approx.
$79,000.
Due to the press release  by PG&E concerning the increased  occurance of PCB's into their system, SoCal has initiated increased sampling  activities on their system and will be proposing to do additional monitoring  to track liquids from Transwestern's M/S into the SoCal system.
Preliminary  sampling results at strategic liquids locations on the SoCal system has  revealed hits of PCB's in the range of 7-10 ppm, although, a  hit of 77 ppm   was discovered.
As a result of an isolated hit of PCB's into the new filter separator at the  PG&E C/S in excess of regulated levels, a  conference call was held the ET&S  VP to determine forthcoming activities with PG&E.
A meeting has been  scheduled at the PG&E C/S next week to reveiw sampling on the PG&E system and  discuss the recent hit of PCB's in the F/S and what forthcoming activities  will be conducted at the site.

1403,"As a result of the latest meeting with PG&E over the greater than 500 ppm PCB  liquids collection at the PGE Topock C/S filter separator (F/S), presented  below is a summary of the deconning and sampling activity which occurred  6/29/00.
Vector was instructed to use a high caustic detergent (Cimclean) as the  cleaning agent for removing PCB's from the Topock F/S (50:50 Cimclean:water  mixture).
Diesel was not used in the deconning process.
The only equipment  cleaned by Vector was the PG&E F/S.
Transwestern's filters in its separator  were replaced,  but no cleaning or deconning was perfromed to this unit.
The filters were also replaced in the PG&E separator.
The following samples were collected during this project:  On the Transwestern side:   1.
Wipes (3) of the interrior body of our filter separator after the filters  were removed.
Large areas were wiped to determine presence/absence of    PCB's.
(Not 100 sq.
cm.
sample)   2.
A composite sample of a used filter removed from the upstream separator  at the Selexol Plant.
The filters appeared to be exceptionally clean    3.
Composite sample of the fine powdery rust  which had collected in the  bottom of the F/S.
Approximte volume one cup.
4.
Composite sample of the used filters from the F/S.
Visible appearance of  the filters removed from this vessel showed them to be clean and    virtually  unstained.
A small discoloration was present on the ends of each filter  confirming that the filters were sealed properly in the F/S.
5.
A sample of an unused clean stocked filter.
This was a control sample.
On the PG&E side:   1.
A liquids sample of the residual in the upstream leg of the Topock filter  separator prior to deconning.
Approx.
volume one cup   2.
Sample of the solids (fine, blackened, powder) which had collected in the  F/S.
An estimate of the volume of this material removed form the F/S   prior  to deconning was approximately one gallon.
3.
Wipe samples (3) of the interrior of the F/S prior to deconning (not 100  cm sq.
wipe)   4.
Used filter media from the F/S.
The operation of the F/S filters are  designed to be a twice pass through of the same filter.
Composite samples    were collected of the upstream and downstream portions of the filters.
5.
Wipes (3) of the deconned filter separator interrior walls.
The only inconsistency observed during the cleaning and inspection process  was the volume and  buildup of the black fine powdery hydrcarbon material  which was present in the F/S at the Topock C/S and conspicuously small amount  of rust colored material which was present  in Transwestern's F/S .
As  previously mentioned, samples were collected of  both materials.
The only  difference between the two locations was the color of the materials and the  volume.
It is suspected that the deconning activity conducted in August of  99 loosened hydrocarbon solids present in the 1850 feet of pipe which had  over time moved and collected in the PG&E F/S.
The small amount of rust  materials observed in the Transwestern F/S is the result of the pigging  activity from the Selexol Plant into the Transwestern F/S.
I will have  reprensentataive samples of both materials.
Photographs  were also taken of the cleaning and inspection activities and  will be available for review at the forthcoming meeting in Flagstaff with  PG&E.

The positives being the information which Steve  and company will collect.
This appears to be a  very useful tool.
There is  also is no permit emission limits associated with the permit at this  facility.
There also exists the potential to pay lower emissions fees should  this investigation show that the emissions from the units to be significantly  lower than what was placed into the permit application.
The downside to this  effort is that the data we collect may in fact show that our emissions fees  which we have been paying actually under estimate those submitted in our  application and we would more than likely be held accountable for the  difference (1996 to the present).
Additionally, enforcement action could  result by the Navajos.
I say this to apprise everyone of the positive and  negative potentials involved in completing this study.
From the emission  estimates which were placed into the permit application we included a  defendable buffer or excess of emissions to account for variations in the  temperature, humidity, engine age and poor engine mechanics should they  exist.
And finally, we have the unknown of not knowing what the three units actually  emit.

1408,"I want to bring interrested parties up to date on the issue of replacing the  fuel mixers with carbuerators at  the Spraberry Plant.
It seems that this  replacement was performed ONLY as a fuel savings activity and that there  would be no increase in emissions or horsepower as a result.
According to  the TNRCC, they will allow this activity provided that the above is true and  that we prove that emissions and horsepower will not increase.
To do this  they have requested that we conduct an emissions test on one of the units  with the mixer on and then with the carbuerator on as a condition of their  approval.
IE before and after testing.
I am going to request that we be  allowed to do the testing with a portable emissions tester, which has been  verified in side by side testing on New Mexico units as opposed to bringing  in a third party referenced testing company.
Contractor testing runs about  $3-5,000.
A condition of all permitting issues is that the carbs are not supposed to be  installed on the units (preconstruction) until approval has been given by the  agency.
In this case, we will be allowed to install a carbuerator on the one  unit to be tested but not on all units.
Should testing show other  exceedances (emissions or Hp) in addition to fuel savings, this will trigger  actions requiring perimtting.
Under the circumstances, I think it would be  in the best interest of NNG to know for certain that we have not violated the  grandfather status of the units and that if our activity requires permitting,  we comply immediately.
I am sending out the letter request to the TNRCC today.
If approved, we  should test ASAP.
Remember, that sampling ports in the exhaust stack of the  unit to be tested will need to be constructed prior to testing.

1415,"I wanted to present this summary of the meeting Transwestern had with  representatives of the Laguna Pueblo concerning the status of the PCB  remediation activities by TW.
On the Laguna side were members of the Laguna  pueblo, the PEOP a  technical oversight group that provides expertise and  assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in New Mexico  (ranging from UST to superfund), and members of ETS ( 5 members of the Laguna  team, Butch Russell, Rick Smith  (advisor for the Laguna team), myself)  and  George Robinson.
This is the third meeting we had in the last year and a  half with this group since the Lagunas have started showing renewed interest  in environmental activities on their pueblo.
The meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the UST  and the PCB remediation activity.
With respect to the first, concensus was  reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples  at the two downstream well locations from the UST site on a quarterly basis,  and send the results to POEP for review.
With repsect to the PCB remediation issue, things were a little different.
The POEP representatives expressed concern on behalf of the Laguna tribal  Coucil that the progress of the remediation activities Transwestern is  presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals  toward  achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the  Lagunas have verified this.
They indicated that that have been patient with  Transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the PCB  contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this  technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have  shown stagnant results  (Im using their words).
They would like to see  Transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup  and closure of this site.
Members of the Laguna pueblo, who work for the  POEP,  expressed concern that the PCB contamination could negatively impact  future generations of Lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of  Transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their  lands.
One member of the Laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer""   with potential to spread.
A comment was made by the POEP that there was a  major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination  if we continue to just maintain  our present approach of just monitoring the  site and installing additional wells..  A member of the POEP has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from  North Dakota State University, (Energy and Environmental Research Center) who  claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered  difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due  to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and  channels present which direct  the PCB containing liquids present at the  site).
Although the POEP was not recommending Transwestern utilize their  service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site  with them.
It shold also be mentioned that Syed Risvi, the POEP Superfund representative  was at this meeting.
He had mentioned that the  POEP has been in discussions  with EPA Region VI concerning potential classification of the site on the  CERCLIS list of sites for inclusion on the NPL..
He had indicated that he  did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that  Transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation  efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being  done.
At the conclusion of the meeting, I informed the POEP that Transwestern's  internal remediation group  would contact the NDSU group and discuss the site  characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our  discussions.
This seemed to satisify the  POEP and they were content with  this.
John, I would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of  people and discuss this issue.
A couple of things I want to bring out.
First, we will be undergoing ROW and Compressor Station renewals with the  Lagunas in the near future.
Second, on the Laguna tribal lands, they have  experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to  this whole  contamination problem.
Although we are considered by the POEP as  proactive up to this point  and very easy to work with (direct quote from the  POEP)   they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from  Transwestern to clean up the PCBs.
Please get back with me on this.

Please  have someone from each team present at each location during the surveys and  allow access to the facility by the archeologist.
The survey should only  last 3-4 hours.
Donna, I spoke to the Navajo Nation about expiditing the report submittal  once the archeological surveys have been completed and the Nation  said that  under their current regulations, assuming that there are no cultural  resources identified at either location, they are allowed 30 days to review  the findings before they are required to issue the final report.
She didnt  think it would take this long, but said that due to existing surveys back  logs, and personnel, it might.
Ill keep the pressure on.
The Navajo Nation F&W has not returned my call about what they might  require.
Birds of a feather...  Ill be persistent here also.......and let  you know when I find out something..........

1421,"Bill, things have pretty much quieted down on Rogas as compared to the last  couple of weeks, but heres whats new:  A meeting has been scheduled on 3/16 with the California Fish and Game to  discuss the following issues:  1)presentaiton of the 1999 and 2000 annual  reports which are required by the facility's 2081 permit.
2) developing an  agreement with F&G as to how the 41 acre credits held by EOTT will be managed  to ensure compliance with requirements of the F&G.
3) Presentation of the  results relating to surveys conducted in the path of construction for the  Rogas project.
The waiver to lay pipeline above ground for the Rogas constsruction was  approved by the Offfice of the State Fire Marshall, Pipeline Safety  Division.
There were 8 city, county, state and federal agencies notified by  application for approval to construct the 9 mile pipline system consisting of  3 piplines.
This is the only agency approval received as yet.
Acre credits were obtained from Aera for the construction of the Rogas  pipeline.
Aera is an oil company with major holdings of acreage available  for purchase.
It was felt that due to the time constraints for initiating  this project and the concern with not receiving the credits from the F&G that  EOTT would purchase Aera credits to ensure procurement of the necessary  acreage for the Rogas project.
This is a major plus for the project.

1425,"INTERNAL COMMUNICATION REGARDING DELAYS  IN RETAIL COMPETITION IN TEXAS October 29, 2001  The main purpose of this memo is to inform EPMI and EES commercial teams regarding the implementation status of retail competition Texas, particularly in non-ERCOT regions, which  include parts of the areas served by the following utilities:  ?
Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO) and West Texas Utilities Company (WTU) - both in the SPP region ?
Entergy Gulf States (EGSI) - in the Energy-SERC region  As most of you probably have heard, the Texas Utility Commission has been examining, in the last few weeks, the readiness to implement retail competition in those areas.
The Public Utility Commission of Texas (Staff) has filed petitions seeking a determination of whether market institutions are ready for retail competition in above areas, to start January 01, 2002.
There is a concern among the Commission and many other participants that non-ERCOT-Texas regions are not ready for competition.
This concern has two major causes: -	Lack of a vibrant, efficient wholesale market in those regions, where newly established REPs could have full access to others suppliers, on a non-discriminatory basis -	      Lack of success in the retail pilot programs developed in 2001 - no alternative suppliers and no customer shifting at all; a recent hearing has confirmed most REPs absolute lack of interest in those regions - at least for the time being  SPP  Last Week, the Public Utility Commission decided to delay competition in SPP Texas.
Or, more accurately, ""to delay customer choice"", in the Commission preferred language.
Enron, who was requested to file a testimony, opposed to any delays, under the argument that SPP is not a ""perfect market"", but REPs could trade in this market as other marketers do.
No final dates have been established yet.
However, one estimates that the delay may vary from 12 to 18 months.
The Commission has established some clear actions and milestones before retail competition is implemented: -	Support SPP to begin wholesale market operations, which involves refinements and upgrades in a few of existing systems, such as settlement; -	      Reform in SPP Tariffs and implementation of a market based congestion management; -	      Continue the pilot, attract new competitors and open the market.
As part of this effort, the Commission created a Southwest Power Pool Market Readiness Implementation Project (Docket # 24869) to develop the necessary steps to transition to full competition, identify milestones, monitor progress and report to the Commission on a regular basis.
Enron will be supporting this effort.
SERC  SERC regions bear resemblance with SPP, in terms of Commission's intent to delay competition.
The most important difference is that the incumbent utility, EGSI, an Entergy subsidiary, has strongly supported timely implementation.
The Commission fears that Entergy will benefit from its ""monopolistic""  position in the region, in the absence of other REPs.  No final decisions have been made yet.
Entergy Gulf States, in conjunction with the Commission Staff and other interested parties have gone through a settlement process, whereby retail competition will be delayed until September 15, 2002.
The subject is still being examined by the Commission and no final decisions have been made.
However, we expect the Commission to approve the Settlement Agreement, therefore delaying competition until September 15, 2002.
ERCOT  All the discussion about delays in competition focuses on non-ERCOT Texas only.
There are rumors and ongoing discussions about delaying competition in ERCOT-Texas, which is scheduled to take place on  January 01, 2002.
For example, Nancy Hetrich from Enron, will be attending the Legislative Oversight Committee on Friday, November 02.
She will be appearing in her capacity of Chair of RMS Sub-Committee.
Contrary to non-ERCOT, there is a strong support from  most industry participants to have retail competition on time.
Besides, the results from the pilots were successful and ERCOT is supposed to provide vibrant wholesale competition.
Therefore, unlike SPP and Entergy, there should be no material reasons or fears to delay retail competition in ERCOT-Texas.
We will keep you apprised as things evolve.

Rockwood Associates has been exclusively recruiting for domestic energy clients since 1985.
We started by bringing Wall Street quantitative specialists of all levels to physical energy marketing and trading companies.
Today, much of our power and natural gas search work breaks into three areas: (1) risk management and quantitative analysis, (2) structuring/planning, and (3) select assignments in physical power and gas trading.
Other functional areas served: energy consulting, and derivatives marketing.
We're always looking for individuals with strong analytical foundations for various positions.
Experienced Financial Traders We have specific job openings in at least two locations outside of Houston for candidates with experience in power or natural gas OTC markets.
These jobs complement the physical trading done in various US markets and the trader either hedges or takes proprietary positions.
These jobs range from a mid-range job which offers total comp of $275-375K/yr or so to a more highly leveraged position where the person can make more for both the team and him or herself.
One should have a minimum experience of derivatives trading of two years, and someone with more than 7-8 can be utilized as well.
Strong options knowledge is a must.
Power Marketing (EastCoast) This client firm is expanding into additional regions and needs someone with ECAR and adjacent grid experience.
Candidate should have five or more years in the industry, have an in-depth knowledge of the power business and be respected in the power community.
Client is a stable, solid power marketer with five years of systematic growth and management continuity.
Firm has generation in various regions and can design and support structured transactions.
The position offers all that a sales person might want: management support, a strong incentive plan and a good combination of personal responsibility and freedom to develop a marketplace in a systematic way.
Term Marketer For Natural Gas  (East Coast Location) A firm with excellent structuring/analytical support is looking for origination people with solid backgrounds in selling and structuring longer-term deals.
Candidate should have customer contacts that are LDC's, power generators and large industrials in the Midwest.

Energy Derivative Marketers (West Coast/East Coast) We have several openings for those who know derivatives and have successfully sold to energy producers and users.
The right individual will have at least 2 years of experience and must be presently active in the marketplace.
These are great positions for an independent-minded marketer who wants to build his/her own business within a business.
The position will have terrific support from creative derivatives structuring groups.

Our intention is to launch financial products only for our regions beginning with Summer '02 through Cal '03.
As we are successful in signing up counterparties to reach a critical mass, we'll be adding products that are closer to the front of the curve (less correlated to NG.)
We need to do this to protect ourselves from ""ambushes"" by single parties when we don't have a critical mass of players that we can lay risk off with.
Please note that, as a result, we may ""only"" have a couple of more weeks to play with in terms of studying up and refreshing ourselves on the fundamentals in our respective regions.

1437,"Family,  With the recent tragedy, I am unsure when the following invitation will arrive to you via the US Mail.
As many of you know, the US Mail is highly dependent upon our nation's airline system for the normal on-time delivery of cross country mail (normally within 3 to 4 days) which is mailed over approximately 600 miles.
For the time being (and not sure when the prohibition will be lifted) the nation's passenger carrying domestic and international aircraft will not be allowed to fly mail or cargo in the cargo holds.
This measure may go away soon or measures be made for increased x-ray, etc.
However, this may result in delays of mail depending upon how much the trucking and rail industry can ""absorb"" in the cross country movement.
The following invitations to the upcoming Change of Command were mailed on Tuesday, 12th Oct by the office of the Wing Commander of the 436th Airlift Wing (Dover Air Force Base, DE) who will be ""my boss"".
I felt it best to send this e-mail just in case the invitation does not arrive for weeks.
I hope you understand.
As I reflect on the weeks ahead of taking command of the flying operations and port operations of this nation's largest military aerial port and strategic airlift wing we are humbled about the talents of the great many men and women of this operations group as they fly our nation's most precious and important cargoes to all faces of this world through times of peace, contingency and if need be war.

1439,"After giving this trade situation WAY too much  thought, I have arrived at the following conclusions (giving  examples along the way so blockheads like DeFoggi can  understand the concepts).
1.)
One suggestion is to have the online trading  system  allow first come, first serve between specified  hours/days as allotted by the website.
Unfortunately, the  reality is that this won't work because there are available  free agents on MY team and the only way to add/drop is that I  become notified anyway and go in and manually do the  transaction and waive the fee.
2.)
Power ratings so that the low man on the totem  pole gets a chance for first pick.
Okay, so a  trader makes a  bad trade, loses money, gets fired, and then  gets the same job trading elsewhere for more money.
A loser is a  loser and should be acknowledged as such (see Feeley).
Those  are the breaks in this game.
Besides, too time consuming  for me to go through the numbers.
3.)
Free market... first come, first served,  anytime, anywhere.
This is a good concept in that those  that dedicate the time to watching, studying, and anticipating an opportunity  are allowed to seize the moment and get paid.
And they should  because it is just like a small business, you get out of it  what you put into it.
Time is money.
However, you can't do  add/drops once your lineup is set and you should only be able to apply  trades to the upcoming week anyways.
4.)
Calling two fellow team owners to  validate your trade.
Really, would you trust Gibby in this situation?
I can hear  it now, ""Oh yeah, dude, I was drinking a soder pop when he  called but he neva said anything about picking up that QB.""
So, I have reached what I call a fair and amicable  solution to all of your f*cked up problems.
First, the core of someone's team is going to  decide the results week in and week out.
I've been in this long  enough to know that pickups (especially in a big league) are rarely  gonna make that big of a difference in the outcome of a  season.
Past examples  include WR Thrash who had a spectacular  game against Seattle only to turn around and have a dismal game against  the lowly Cowboys.
There was $15 given to the  pot.
What I am getting at is that I think trading is way overrated and only  serves to build the pot for the team that drafted  the strongest in the beginning anyways.
Second, online access allows a level playing  field.
I agree with this and it should be implemented because it is  also time stamped so  there is no question as to who was first in a  selection.
If an owner is going to stoop so low as to change the  clock on their computer to try and get an earlier time stamp, then there  are bigger mental problems down the road and the money you make off  the win should be applied accordingly.
Third, my time is just as important and so is a ""transaction"" period.
For example, this weekend is Octoberfest weekend in Fredericksburg.
If you think I am going to hang around and stay sober so I can meet  your demands and implement your requests, you are sorely mistaken.
I fully expect to start drinking myself into oblivion Friday evening  and  don't expect to come out of my coma until sometime Sunday  evening so your changes/requests/questions need to be done by Friday  afternoon.
SO, here is what I suggest:   1.)
to make an add/drop (trade) transaction, click on the ""Owners""  tab on the league homepage (found up top next to Live Chat), page down to the bottom of the page and send a broadcast  email to ALL team members announcing your intentions.
I will implement  the trade(s) on the Tuesday following the Monday night game.
The transaction  deadline is Friday 5:00 PM for the weekend games.
If I receive the email timestamped before  then, I will make the trade for the upcoming weekend.
IF there is a Thursday night  game, Thursday 5:00 PM is the deadline for THE WEEKEND.
At any time after the deadline if a transaction is submitted, it will apply to the following  weekend.
Also, there will be NO limit on the amount of transactions, feel free to contribute  as much as you wish.
2.)
regarding current requested trades for the past  weekend: for this week only, send ME an email with your request.
I will  take one trade per team this week only.
If two teams want the same free agent,  whoever guesses closes to where the Nasdaq composite closes Wednesday, October 3rd  wins.
The loser will be notified as such.
So, BE SURE TO INCLUDE YOUR GUESS.
This should provide everyone easy online access to making trades.
All you  have  to do is make sure the free agent is indeed free, that nobody has already  sent you an email picking him up, and shoot a broadcast out to the owners  proclaiming  him as yours.
Simple.
So, any questions or concerns can be sent back to discuss.
I will shoot  down all of them.
I am going to lunch.
I eagerly await the opportunity to tell you  why your plan won't work.
Craig, the commish

1443,"Hey Cat Fans - Saturday was sort of a  disappointment - but life goes on.
I have just heard, unofficially, that  the KSU/A & M game on the 20th WILL BE televised.
I had been concerned  that the way both teams played Saturday that the game might not make it on the  tube.
However, the time of the game has not been determined.
Will  have to let you know later what time to come to the SRO on the  20th.
In the meantime, we have our big  ""Sunflowers and Sage"" dinner on Sunday night.
If you have your  registration form and have not sent it in yet,  just come and pay at the  door.
We have a good time with our auction and all proceeds go to our  scholarship fund, which helps a needy student.
So, until Sunday -    GO  CATS

1444,"The World Wide RibFest ""celebration of the Rib"" is coming up.
This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time).
I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne.
For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).
A blind-judging takes place to determine the winner, but often the crowd gets up in arms and nominates a ""peoples choice"" (though this is not officially recognized by the sanctioning body).
Every year, my wife asks the following: 	""So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?""
I reply:	""Nothing comes to mind.""
She replies:	""No.""
As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.
So, appetizers, sides, desserts and food & drink for the kids are also served.
The competition around the grills gets a little rough, so I recommend that the young and faint-of-heart maintain a safe distance while the cooking and competition is taking place.
The appropriate College football games will be broadcast, so you don't have to worry about missing any games.
There are a couple of changes to this year's competition: The competition will be held at the John Mee/Laura Benjamins compound in Bellaire Mike Paradise (who won the very first ribfest) has stepped out of the competition this year citing ""personal reasons""  Date & Time Saturday November 3rd.
We fire the grills up around 12:00, and the judging takes place between 3:00 and 3:30.
Where 4807 Elm Street in Bellaire  Directions (from John Mee himself) From downtown, take 59s to 610s.
The first exit is the Bissonette//Fournace exit.
Take this exit and go through the light, noting the gouging in the lamppost from that freak cherry-picker accident from last April.
Before the Bisonette light, there is a big Chase Bank Building.
Right before that building is Elm Street.
Take a right on Elm Street exactly 236 yards to 4807 Elm Street.
Go inside and ask for directions there, cause I really don't have a clue...
KIDS Bring 'em!
We'll have the Moonwalk set up for them again this year, and we'll have hot dogs, burgers, popcorn and drinks for them.
The more kids the better.
What you need to bring Nothing, except maybe some attitude to heckle the cooks while they try to concentrate.

1457,"<<analysis revision 3.xls>>  Kriste:  Here is a chart prepared by our statistician indicating adverse impact based on the spreadsheet that we received on Monday.
As we have discussed before, the more relevant statistics are the job group numbers and not the gross statistics.
Allan King also called me after he sent me this and said that Rob Speakman (the statistician) also said that he was able to compare the HR staff selected for layoff versus the HR general population and there was statistically significant adverse impact of 10 on gender and 12 on African-American.
He asked if this group was selected as a group or if this was an amalgamation of HR employees from the various operating companies.
I said that I thought that there was at least a component of a centralized decisionmaking.
Accordingly, we probably need to discuss those statistics.
Give me a call when you receive this.

1458,"Michelle:  Here is the first response I received from one of our senior partners in SF:  I think the best thing such a client can do is to use a reputable security outfit (such as Kroll Associates) to give the co. a very thorough assessment.
I think, quite frankly, that relying on the advice of such an outfit would provide more legal protection than talking to all of the lawyers in the world, although our advice could be an additional benefit.
As you know, we have an extensive task force report on workplace violence that would be relevant to this inquiry and could provide the basis for an analysis of this issue, although other areas would have to be explored.
I am soliciting comments about the HR consultant you referenced.

It was decided that individuals who gave up jobs to accept our offer would be paid out one month of salary (with a signed release).

Will they be paid out?

My understanding is that the terminations letter will be mailed out soon.

1476,"Dear  Michelle:       I  just finished my conference call with Liz Miller (counsel for Calpine),  Christina Solomon, and Steve Schuler (Steve is co-counsel for Miller with  Christina).
Christina had passed along to Liz the various points I made at  the meeting last week, so Liz was prepared to address our primary  concerns.
She made the following points:                    (1)    She has talked with several different people at various  levels of authority in Calpine's trading area, and insists that Calpine treats  the power grids as ""completely different"" regions, strategies for which are not  shared internally among those regions.
(2)    She asserts that ""how we do it at Calpine is totally  different from Enron,"" since Calpine is ""trading around a portfolio of assets  that we own.""
She asserted that Enron, not owning power generation assets,  trades differently.
When I replied that Enron does have power generation  assets, she acknowledged the fact but insisted that Enron's trading style is  vastly different due to the difference in emphasis vis a vis the power  generation assets.
(3)    Liz claims that Miller works almost exclusively in  ""Urcot"" (sp??)
in Texas, with some participation in Entergy in Louisiana.
According to Liz, Calpine's strategies concerning these specific regions is  divorced from and not related in any way with any trading Calpine does in the  East or West.
(4)    Liz is of the opinion that Miller ""is not senior enough  that we would be looking for what he knows.""
He has no role whatsoever in  discussing or formulating strategy for trading.
Miller, she insists, is on  the receiving end only.
He takes orders, dispatching and scheduling  solely in response to orders he receives from others.
(5)    Liz acknowledges that, were Miller in a more senior,  responsible position, she would have the same concerns we are expressing were  the tables turned.
Miller is ""so slotted,"" however, that she believes that  he is not in a position to use any Enron trade secret that he might possess  (though she and Miller's attorneys expressed doubt that he could retain any  critical information, that the most critical information changes on a day-to-day  basis).
We  ended the conversation with the following  understandings:           (1)    Liz  will explore whether Calpine could put Miller in a non-trading function for a  period of two months or so.

Obviously we have a number of contracts we entered into between Jun 99 and the beginning of the end of last year which have some sort of wording along the above lines in them.
There are some critical questions I would like to get clarity on:  If BU's and support functions simply stop at 10/80/10 in their PRC's how will we deal with these contracts?
Presuming all commercial staff are also relative ranked for bonus purposes separately to the PRC, can we use this scale instead (where it will be easier to identify a to half or quartile performance).
Do we need to ensure that BU's and Functions that have people with such wording do split their middle 80%.
If so how should we do this?
Do we need to amend those contracts to wording that is easier to interpret?
What proof or disclosure will we need to those individuals with this wording?
I have a PRC committee meeting Thurs and while I don't anticipate raising this issue in that forum, I'd like to know we are working on a solution.

We were prepared that he would come back with this and we will continue to pay him, but it's this last statement about the notification of termination that concerns me.
I would have thought that our presentation of a separation agreement to him back in November would have been enough written ""notification"" that we do not wish to continue his employment past the contract end date, but in speaking with him further, he seems to think that its not.
His contract states that if the Company terminates your employment without 12 months written notice, then the Company shall pay you the remainder of your salary for the 12 months from the date it gave your notice, in a lump sum.
His contract end date is 6/30/2002 and the last thing we want to do is to pay him additional money.

While I know that we don't have a decision on severance, Michelle Cash and I have discussed most likely only being able to include a link to the restated plan.

Also covered are any personal effects or items, including desks, lockers, workstations, personal belongings, and privately owned vehicles located on or in Company property.
Leave in the phrase, ""...attending an Enron-sponsored function off Company premises..."" in referencing locations where an employee should not be impaired by alcohol or drugs, as reasonable efforts are made to provide safe transportation and/or other options for impaired employees at Enron-sponsored social functions.

1523,"Dear  Michelle:        On Tuesday, October 23, I met with Christina Solomon, counsel for Doug  Miller.
The elusive Liz Miller failed to attend, having been called at the  last minute into an all-day meeting.
We have tentatively agreed that we  will meet next week.
Despite Liz Miller's absence, I believe that the meeting was productive.
I  learned the following information:        1.
Doug Miller claims that there are three power grids that  are unrelated, that he worked only in the East for ENA and works only in Texas  for Calpine.
Thus, he claims that his duties and activities do not overlap  in any way with those he performed for ENA.
2.
Calpine did not know of Miller's non-compete at the time  Miller was hired because he believed it had expired.
He brought it to  Calpine's attention immediately upon being contacted by ENA.
3.
Christina argued, as she did in the answer and  counterclaim, that the non-compete agreement was fatally overbroad, as Miller  never had any duties involving the majority of the activities from which the  non-compete purports to bar him.
In response, I told her the following:            1.
We do not accept Miller's assertion that simply working in  another region will sufficiently insulate our trade secrets, since strategies  may not be confined to a single region.
2.
I pointed out to her that Miller's contract very clearly  states that the non-compete extends three months after employment even if the  contract term has expired.
I also pointed out that he was reminded of his  non-compete orally several times by ENA personnel upon his  resignation.
3.
I explained that the non-compete had been enforced on many  occasions and that it was carefully crafted with an eye to protecting the many  trade secrets to which Miller may have had access.
I argued that  strategies concerning one aspect of ENA's business might impact many other areas  and that, as such, the non-compete was not overly broad.
[She asked what  trade secrets we were trying to protect!!
I, of course, declined to  answer.]
Despite the fact that I believe that these facts are clearly  stated in our petition, she confessed to not having viewed the situation from  the ""trade secret perspective.""
We ended the meeting with her stating that Calpine and Miller were both  interested in trying to resolve the matter and that she welcomes a proposal from  us.
While she did not elaborate, I believe that they would entertain a  suggestion of some sort of limitation on his activities for some short  period of time.
Please let me have your thoughts about this matter.
Thanks.
Best  regards,

",Anonymous Letters
1557,"Anne,  I have reviewed the P&S Agreement for Triple Lutz.
From my perspective, it  generally looks fine.
I have a few comments, and invite Pat Mackin to add  any he may have, in particular based on his review of Section 4.14.
In Section 4.7(c)(iv), there is a reference to any contract obligations.
I  believe this would include employment contracts, which do not appear to be  identified specifically on any schedule unless the annual amount exceeds  $250K.
We may want to clarify that the disclosures are consistent with the  provisions of Section 4.13(iii).
Section 4.8 provides that we will not enter into any employee benefits not  required by law.
However, given that closing is pushed out so far in the  future, we may want the flexibility to provide incentive bonuses for key  personnel to stay with the company through closing.
This may be done with  the Buyer's consent, but we may be tying our hands.
Section 6.2(e) contains  a similar restriction on making payments to officers/directors.
In addition, Section 4.8 states that we won't enter into or amend any  employment contracts.
We do not renew employment contracts at a single time,  and the contracts of key personnel may expire.
Do we want to tie our hands  and be prohibited from amending/extending the agreements?
Section 6.2(l)  also prohibits the modification/amendment of contracts with employees.
In Section 4.10, the wording ""(other than Environmental Laws)"" suggests that  we are not in compliance with environmental laws.
Rephrasing that sentence  to refer to the provision of the Agreement may be preferable.
In Section 4.11(d), we promise that we haven't provided any gift of any kind  to customers.
I don't think we can say that, given that we regularly host  client development outings (e.g.
Rodeo BBQ tickets, golf tourneys, etc.)
and  provide Enron goodies to people all the time.
Perhaps a limitation on de  minimus gifts would be more accurate.
Also, a reference to our Code of  Ethics may work here.
In Section 4.13(a)(iii), does the $250K threshhold include only cash value,  or does it include equity grants that vest over time?
A reference to ""cash""  payments would clarify, given that people here are compensated by stock  options/restricted stock that vest over time.
In Section 4.14(d), I am not sure whether this transaction accelerates  vesting -- Pat, do you know?

Currently, I have been receiving documents from outside counsel and  initialling them before signature.
Based upon Hoyt's email below, there may  be a desire to have a more expeditious process.
I would suppose the answer would depend on how heavily our legal department  is going to be involved in GSP work.
Given our discussion last week, I would  not think that there would be a desire to deviate significantly from the  standard Enron process, but it is not my call.

We could agree to enter into a Consulting Services Agreement with Kevin.
The  terms of that Agreement would include:  1.
He agrees to be available and cooperative with Enron and its counsel  regarding litigation matters.
He will agree to meet with counsel, prepare  for testimony, review documents, testify, and provide other assistance, as  needed.
2.
Through February 1, 2001, Kevin would not be directly compensated for this  cooperation/testimony (because he is to be receiving his salary pursuant to  the terms of his employment agreement).
After Feb.1, 2001, he will be paid a  rate of $125 per hour for his services in this regard.

I have received a question from NEPCO about Project 50.

These are hourly employees who do not work regularly.
Originally, these  employees were thought to be included in the scope of Project 50 by corp.   Mike Indivero called me and said that these people should not receive the 50  options because they are not ""regular, full-time or regular part-time  employees"" as described in the memo from the Office of the Chairman.

It would appear that the E.=  globulus species holds up better than the various Brazilian species during=  the refining process.
While most papermakers generally don't refine hardw= oods and softwoods with the same equipment, many smaller European mills are=  unable to afford the capital investment of a second refiner and accordingl= y do use a single refiner for all grades.
This is particularly true of the=  Italian mills.
Since hardwoods cannot withstand the rigorous refining req= uired for softwoods without losing their papermaking characteristics (opaci= ty, etc.
), these papermakers need to utilize the hardwood species best suit= ed for this type of processing.
Accordingly, the globulus species (which i= s also the predominant species in the Iberian peninsula) holds up much bett= er under this type of heavy refining than any other species of eucalyptus.
In any case, I hope this helps shed additional light on this issue, and, as=  always, please feel free to revert with any questions you might have.

1595,"Dynegy Is Mulling $2 Billion Investment In Enron in Possible Step Toward Merger By ROBIN SIDEL  Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL  Dynegy Inc. is in advanced discussions to infuse about $2 billion into Enron Corp. in a transaction that may lead to a full-blown merger between the two companies, people familiar with the matter said.
A formal transaction could be unveiled as early as Thursday, these people said.
The situation is very fluid and is subject to change, these people noted.
Enron has been rocked by last month's disclosure of a $1.2 billion reduction in its equity base partly tied to financial dealings with company partnerships headed by Enron's former chief financial officer.
Last month, it reported a third-quarter loss of $618 million.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the matter.
Last week, Enron secured $1 billion in new credit lines, using gas-pipeline assets as collateral.
Enron needs the infusion in part because its previously announced plans to raise cash through the sale of power assets is going more slowly than expected.
Mostly, though, it needs to restore its credibility with Wall Street at a time when its access to the financing markets is drying up.

While I feel reasonably comfortable with the numbers and the timing of projects coming online, some additional work will be required to gain 100% confidence in this information.
This should be completed within the next two weeks.
In addition, as the trend of replacing mixed tropical hardwood with higher quality plantation acacia is already underway, I will make an attempt to identify the timber resources of the largest market pulp producers and when they anticipate initiating production of acacia pulp.
Given the scope of this project, it may require several weeks to complete.
Finally, I'm considering implementing a monitoring system similiar to the one already covering the Brazilian producers so we can accurately track activity by the Indonesian producers.

As directed, the tariff sheets removed  the daily  high/low index price for cash-out.
In response, Texas Gas proposes to establish a cash-out price based on a weekly high/low index price determined from the weeks within the applicable month, plus the first week of the following month.
The primary and alternate sheets require in-kind make-up  of imbalances up to 2% and use the same index price  for  imbalances  above 5%.
However,  the primary sheets also propose to eliminate cash-out for all imbalances up to  5%  by also requiring a mandatory in-kind make-up level from 2% to 5% and by eliminating any use of the 100% price index for this tier of imbalance.
Texas Gas states that copies of  the revised  tariff sheets are being mailed to Texas  Gas's  jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.

I have also finished summarizing within each month the total Cash Out qty and the total Cash In qty and priced each at the appropriate cash in/out price.

1692,"Diana and Sean:  Just wondering if you happen to know how the scheduling volume in these two deals work?
I believe when we liquidate at the beginning of this month (for example, 8/2) , the volume was zero in stead of 50MW/hr in scheduling.
Would you advise how the ""timing"" of entering the volume in scheduling was determined?
I am asking because it looks like for the first few days of this month we didn't liquidate anything because at the time the volume in scheduling was zero.
If somebody added the volume later, we will need to know in order to correct total liquidations before the ""incomplete liquidations"" get to Settlements at month-end.
Please advise, thanks!!

1693,"Sean:  I have been looking at the -$141K P&L hit in ""Other Changes"" on 8/13/01 you were inquiring about.
The biggest ""contributor"" of this hit is the restructured Modesto deal # 520328.3, which alone caused -$130K in Other Changes (a.k.a.
2nd Order in financial terms).
I believe what happened is that Matt re-marked the daily volatility curves down by a significant magnitude on 8/13/01 (* please see curve managers for the change).
Usually when volatilities changed drastically they would disrupt financial evaluation models and more likely to cause a change in deal value by factors which cannot be explained (i.e.
Second Order).
This doesn't necessarily mean that the evaluation is incorrect but just that there will be some value change for which the models cannot pinpoint the reasons.
Anyway, for this basis option deal you lost $94K on 8/13, and this -$94K can be broken down into Curve Shift (-$19K), Gamma ($1.5K), Vega (70K), Theta (-16K), and Second Order/Other Changes (-$130K).
I looked at the curve change and interest rate change between 8/10 and 8/13 and they are relatively insignificant, but the drastic volatility mark down makes me feel that your losing money in this deal is somewhat consistent w/ what we should expect.
I am still working with IT to see if we can nail this down to give you a more specific explanation.
In the mean time, if you have any thoughts or concerns, please feel free to let me know.

1695,"Diana -    I have the following charges on BPA's revised final bills and was wondering if you could tell me who's books these should go on?
October 2000	  $ 3,214   February 2001   $ 4,153    I spoke with Corrine Surface at BPA and learned that these charges are being applied given the following situation:    On October 10, 2000 and February 1, 5, and 6, 2001, our Real-Time group called BPA to reserve transmission for some schedules.
Our R-T guys requested tranny using account numbers (such as 794811) that were for day-ahead firm transmission, thus entering the field of Unauthorized Increase Charges (incurred at $12,000/MWh) .
Since BPA did not go over the structure of the product in that account, they are not going to charge us the $12,000 per MWh, but since we did get firm transmission, we will have to pay the $59/Mwh for the firm; hence the above charges.
I understand that you have also spoken with Corrine at BPA and were going to talk to Bill.

Ed, Harlan and I discussed some aspects of this earlier today.
Some additional information that Steve Hall and I just discussed is summarized below.
The effect of this termination on our power scheduling is that the West Desk is now short by 202 MW over its earlier position.
After termination the contract positions are:   COB:  		150 MW on peak (purchase from BPA) 		200 MW off-peak (purchase from BPA)   Mid-C:		(339) MW on peak (delivery to BPA) 		(238) MW off peak (delivery to BPA)  Terminated contract numbers:  	97 PB-10123  (Wauna/James River) 	98 PB-10277 (Firm Power Sale)  The termination fo the Wauna/James River contract presumably also terminates the ""book out"" agreement negotiated earlier this year, and increases our net short position to BPA.

1741,"Hello Friends and Colleagues,  I am excited to tell you that starting January 7, 2002, I will have a new job.
I will be the Vice President of Research Programs at the new Electricity Innovation Institute in Palo Alto, CA.
EII is a spin-off from the Electric Power Research Institute.
It's purpose is to lead public/private research collaboration for clean, efficient energy and the quality of life opportunities that electrcity-based innovation provides.
Our first two projects will deal with reliability of the electric system and integration of distributed generation into the existing distribution grid.
I have really enjoyed my time with Green Mountain Energy Company and firmly believe that customers will choose a cleaner, ""greener"" electricity product if given the opportunity.
However, this is a good time for me to go in a new direction.
Starting January 7, you can reach me at 650.855.2100.

www.caem.org  Please identify which question below is being addressed by your prediction.
CAEM PREDICTIONS IN 2002  What does Enron?s collapse mean?
1.
Markets work.
Markets quickly punish mistakes.
Little slack is given for past accomplishments.
Markets are ruthlessly impersonal.
2.
No likely short term impact on consumers, other traders will fill the space left by Enron.
Amazing that a company as large as Enron can fail and hardly cause a ripple in markets.
Testimonial to benefits of markets.
3.
May have significant impact on public policy advocacy.
Not obvious who picks up the slack.
Enron could be counted on to be there, or so it appeared.
No more free riders, we will all have to dig deeper and work harder.
Consumers may be mid to long term losers if movement toward competition collapses, which it might do if states stretch out the transition period to competition.
4.
Enron?s collapse was not caused by deregulation.
Viewed thoughtfully, it should not have any effect on deregulation movement.
Does not stand for proposition that deregulation is not the right policy.
5.
Look for more regulation and oversight of energy transactions, accounting and business practices.
A strange legacy for Enron, but a reality.
6.
As a practical matter, it is another setback for restructuring.
But not as bad as portrayed by media ?
Enron was the 600 pound gorilla that angered friends of competition almost as much as foes, thus making them less willing to step forward.
Will feed growing skepticism many have about restructuring.
7.
Enron?s global reach into wholesale and retail markets meant that its policy positions were sometimes blurred (pro-wholesale?
pro energy services?)
Other corporations will now replace Enron in public policy debates; these corporations may have a clearer focus.
8.
Still, we have lost a champion.
CAEM will miss their culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations, which led to the unbundling of the classic power contract (or paper or water, etc) into its constituent parts and offered customers choices on each one.
Enron also pioneered risk assessment and control systems.
What will be the fate of the movement towards retail energy competition in 2002?
1.
CAEM believes that the movement toward retail energy competition will continue ?
albeit much more slowly.
2.
Texas is the best model to date and will set the standard for other states in 2002 and beyond.
Why?
The best incentives are in place for large numbers of commercial and industrial consumers to competitively shop for supply.
The Texas model ties changes to the wholesale market to the retail market.
(Texas, through ERCOT, is unique in this respect.)
No price caps.
Market power of incumbents is limited.
Enlightened leadership at the Texas PUC from 1995 to 2000 (our friend, Pat Wood again ?
but we believe Commissioner Perlman is a star as well) and in the Governor?s office.
3.
Other states that have already made a decision to move forward will seek to correct deficiencies ?
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, etc.
?
or avoid past mistakes altogether ?
Virginia.
However, there will be very limited movement in these states.
4.
California will continue to suffer from a lack of imagination and poor leadership from the Governor on down.
There is a good chance that CAEM will again be awarding Governor Davis the ?Red China?
award in 2002.
5.
Californians will be reminded again that rolling blackouts are a form of ?involuntary?
conservation.
6.
Very limited movement, perhaps some experimentation or demonstration projects, in those states that have done nothing to date.
7.
Increasing effort to approximate market-like conditions, but under a regulated, cost-based system, with predictable results.
8.
Actually, beyond Texas, the best hope for significant movement towards competition is in North America is in Canada, particularly Alberta and Ontario.
Given the increasing interconnection between the U.S. and Canada, this will slowly work its way into the United States.
9.
It will be another wild ride for energy marketers in 2002.
More power to them.
What will happen on the wholesale side of the picture in 2002?
1.
CAEM believes that there will be significant strides made to increase liquidity and competition in the wholesale market for electricity.
2.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will be successful, to a degree, in implementing Super RTOs (regional transmission organizations).
3.
CAEM supports the Bush Administration?s proposal to give eminent domain to FERC for the siting of new transmission lines.
However, this proposal faces tough sledding in Congress.
CAEM believes it will pass in some form ?
probably very watered down ?
out of necessity, but not out of love.
Many in Congress still believe we can conserve our way to prosperity.
4.
The Federal government and the states will make progress ?
probably embodied in a political deal ?
on greater cooperation.
This will be regional in focus.
Both sides will give significant concessions to realize this.
5.
New players will enter market as it grows, including the oil companies and more foreign-based companies.
Wildcards/ Predictions in 2002   1.
The Bush Administration will come under increasing pressure to show leadership in the area of energy restructuring.
To date, the Bush Administration has stayed on the sidelines ?
except making the right noises here and there ?
of making energy markets more competitive.
This will need to change, beginning with more funds and staff devoted to helping the states on the retail side and supporting FERC in their efforts on the wholesale side.
2.
The new Electricity Advisory Board appointed by DOE Secretary Abraham will be seen for what it is ?
a sop to campaign supporters.
Given its current make up, we expect very little to come of it.
Couldn?t they find more energy marketers, technology companies ?
anyone that is a bit more pro-competition?
3.
The Department of Energy will continue to have little impact -- if any -- on energy restructuring issues and will remain largely irrelevant to the competitive energy market.
",CAEM Predictions for 2002
1743,"Just a reminder when drafting any documents that refer to EES's load:  there are over 17,000 meters associated with this load and any estimates of projected load are based upon incomplete data and a fair amount of guess work.
Tim Coffing has significantly improved this process; however, it is my understanding that we do not have, even at this time, a 100% accurate picture of historic usage, much less precise forecasts.
Therefore, I strongly suggest liberal use of the word approximate when referring to Enron's California load.

Lynch states that this requirement was changed by AB 6X and that, ""I intend to recommend to my colleagues that the requirement to value generation-assets subject to valuation by December 31, 2001 has been superseded by AB 6X.

1760,"The Dean's Office has decided to cancel several of the Spring 2002 electives.
This decision was based not only on the very low pre-enrollment in the four canceled courses but also on the low overall ""occupancy rate"" for all elective courses (still only 46% after the cancellation of the four courses).
This low ""occupancy rate"" was due to the EWMBA having a surprisingly large number of students who graduated in their 5th semester.
Approximately 85 students completed their MBA requirements in December 2001.
The following are the four courses that were cancelled:  E233   Investments, Prof. Shachat E278-3 Business Law, Prof. Ross E296-7 Behavioral Finance, Prof. Odean     (If your work schedules permits, you will be given enrollment priority to the day section.)
BA/E 278-1 Law& Strategy of e-Commerce, Prof. Tiller   Obviously we regret this development, and recognize that this may create a schedule problem for you.
Therefore, we'd like to propose the following two registration options:  Open Classes If you would like to add an elective that did not fill up during the pre-registration process, reply to TJ tj@haas.berkeley.edu <mailto:tj@haas.berkeley.edu>  ASAP, but no later than noon on Friday, January 18th.
We will add the course to your schedule.
This will ensure that you get priority over the other students who will participate in the ADD/DROP phase starting on January 22nd.
Please refer to the attached file to see which classes still open.
Closed Classes  If you would like to get in to an elective which is currently full, and your original bid for the cancelled course would have been sufficient to get in to the now-full course, we will add you to the course as an over enrollment.
Reply to TJ tj@haas.berkeley.edu <mailto:tj@haas.berkeley.edu> ASAP, but no later than 12 noon on Friday, January 18th.
Please refer to the attachment file to see which classes are closed.
Please Note:   Per campus rules, in extraordinary circumstances such as these we are allowed to over-enroll, but by no more than 10% of the official class size.
Thus we have a finite number of spaces to work with.
Please refer to the size column of the first attached file to see how many seats we have to work with.
If more of you want in a class than we can accommodate, we will use original bids as the tie-breaker.

Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas...
There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures.
To facilitate this effort, Jeff has offered to focus some more of his time and effort on coordinating some of the key commercial issues related to California.
Jane and Stephanie need to create a priority list that represents West Gas issues and ""Hot Button"" or action items.
Once created we can work with Jeff on action items.

1768,"A couple of items of note from this weeks IEPA call:  1.
As noted in Steven Kelly's recent e-mail, it looks like Commissioner Laurie is planning to leave the CEC at the end of the year.
The only siting case before him is Roseville, so Kelly thinks it is unlikely he will stay to see the case completed.
Commissioner Moore's term is also up at the end of the year.
Kelly thinks he will try to get an extension on his term 'till his siting cases are complete.
As I think we can all guess, Kelly is not optimistic about the replacements that might be named by Davis to fill their spots.
2.
The proceeding to modify the siting rules seems to be at a bit of a stalemate.
Commissioner Purnell has put forward some draft language to try to break the log jam.
IEPA is getting a copy to send out.
3.
Kelly thinks the critical issues that are going to be addressed in the CPUC IRP process are: a.
The market design issues surrounding procurement practices by utilities (assuming they regain this ability from DWR) b.
Procurement of renewables IEPA is planning to file to be a participating party to these proceedings.
If Enron wants to be a party separately we need to file a letter to that intent by Nov. 9th .
Steven thinks this time around PG&E and Sempra might be on our site on the generation issues b/c of their IPP businesses.
Let me know if you have any questions on these issues.

1769,"CAISO BOG 10/25/01 Notes taken by G. Alan Comnes  Meeting went from about 10:30 to 1 p.m.
Written materials discussed at this meeting are available at www.caiso.com/bog.
1.
Budget.
Board approved budget, which contains a significant increase in GMCs and, for the first time applies GMC fees, on the self provision of A/S.
The motion to adopt was modified to say the Board would revisit budget if, in response to Gov.
Davis requests to par budgets, the CAISO budget is cut.
2.
Retirement plan Audit 3.
Allocation of Above-MCP 487 charges.
This mechanism will improve the allocation of OOM costs so that the per-MWh charges match up with actual OOM costs.
Stated that penalty revenues used to lower OOM costs could come from imbalance penalties.
Action.
approved (?)
to allow staff to make a tariff amendment on this change.
4.
Winter Assessment.
Presentation by staff  Kahn took issue (i.e., did not even want staff report presented) that CAISO does an assessment without consulting the Power Authority, CPUC, and the CEC.
Worried about conflicting with the other resource assessments out there and giving media ways to take shots at DWR buying practices.
In the end, the full presentation was not given but questions were asked about whether the assessment spells trouble or provides assurance.
The answer:  things are tight in some months but are expected to be ok given the level of conservative assumptions used in the analysis.
Action: staff was tasked to compare this assessment with CEC's and others and come back in another month.
5.
Generator maintenance program.
Will use GADS data.
This program is mandatory for PGA generator units.
CAISO staffer represented that no other ISO has a prescriptive program like the one CAISO is proposing.
Current schedule:  brief FERC staff next week, return to Board in November for approval, make FERC filing, implement in early '02.
Benchmarks are based on each unit's historical performance; i.e.
dogs will be benchmarked against their past doggy behavior.
There is no component to raise the ""bar"" on performance but a unit that falls relative to past performance would trigger further review.
6.
MSC Selection Committee.
MSC provides ""independent"" review of the CAISO markets for CAISO, the state, and FERC.
Wolak is the only member left at the moment.
Selection committee will be Sheffrin, Wolak, and Borenstein.
Candidates will go to Exec.
Director and the final candidates to the Board in February 2002 (!).
Kahn questioned how the MSC can survive with only one member and take until February 02 to select a final members.
Nonetheless, the glacially paced schedule was adopted.
7.
FERC RTO Seams Issues.
Steve Greenleaf presented.
Updated BOG on RTO week and said that the ""4 RTO"" model took a step backward (""off the table"" in the words of Chair Wood) in response to criticism from state PUCs on Thursday.
(Is this an accurate recounting of Day 4?).
ISO is engaged in interregional coordination.
Mentioned ""CSIC"" group   Mentions SSGWY's (?
)sponsorship of a market monitoring workshop on November 16.
8.
Update of CERS Settlement BEEP/AS Payment Procedure.
Edison and PG&E ""are making progress"" but no agreement with CERS have been reached.
SDG&E signed and the procedure was implemented at least in part with SDG&E.
9.
Monthly reports: financial.
10.
Monthly reports: DMA.
Sheffrin.
Mostly followed the briefing charts.
Emphasized the following: CERS OOM purchases are generally down and are reasonably priced once purchases and sales are disaggregated.
Said that suppliers are still bidding above costs.
DMA files confidential reports that include info on bidding data weekly to FERC.
Bids are not coming down.
Intrazonal congestion is up due to new generation coming on line.
That allows generators to play the ""dec"" game.

Chairwoman Sarah Reyes (D-Fresno) conducted a similar hearing last month in Silicon Valley at which this proposal was offered by high tech representatives.
As a result, she invited CMTA to speak on this proposal further and to more fully describe how the sales tax exemption would help get California's economy back to health.
CMTA believes that manufacturing and technology strength is essential to a strong California economy.
Historically, our state has been a world leader in these industries which include electronics, biotechnology, aerospace, and the production of goods of every description.
A strong manufacturing base brings high paying jobs and produces an enormous positive ripple effect in the state's economy.
In order to stay in business, manufacturing companies must make enormous investments in capital equipment on a continuing basis.
California taxes the purchases of manufacturing equipment while 46 states do not.
Many of the 46 also provide tax credits to entice manufacturing expansion to their states.
While existing MIC (California's Manufacturers Investment Tax Credit) law provides some companies a partial offset against sales tax liability, California's tax burden in this regard is one of the worst four in the country and much heavier than that of any other industrial state.
Such an exemption would greatly enhance California's attractiveness as a choice for building a new facility or expanding an existing site.
It would bring a direct and immediate incentive for expansion to all companies in all parts of the state in the manufacturing sector.
CMTA will also give testimony on its proposed moratorium on regulatory fees and its measure to reduce electricity rates and provide customer choice in energy.
ENERGY POLICIES REVISITED  As the energy crisis wanes, many of the actions taken in the last year are being revisited.
Here's a sampling of what was done, why policy-makers are taking a second-look, and what may result:     * In January ABX1 1 (Keeley D-Boulder Creek) directed DWR to purchase      electricity, and DWR signed long term contracts at the height of      the crisis.
High fixed prices and reliance on natural gas-fired      generation have caused consumers, environmentalists and the CPUC to      demand renegotiation.
Contract modification could lower prices and      make more room for direct access contracts between customers and      suppliers.
* ABX1 1 also prescribed a financing mechanism that upon second-look      the legislature wants modified by SBX2 18 (Burton D-San Francisco),      which uncouples payment for DWR contracts from payment of bonds.
Citing a preference for SBX2 18 and renegotiation of DWR contracts,      the CPUC refused to approve a rate agreement so that bonds can be      issued.
The Governor promises to veto SBX2 18, but has started      reviewing DWR contracts.
* The Power Authority was created to ensure a 15% reserve margin in      electricity supplies.
This spring it issued an RFP for supply, but      was informed recently by DWR that no additional long term supply is      required.
Assemblyman Keeley will hold a hearing this month to      review the mission and activities of the Power Authority.
* Last year the legislature passed a bill requiring all generators      sited under expedited 4 month licensing to switch from simple cycle      to cleaner combined-cycle within 3 years.
On November 5th, under      the Governor's emergency powers, the CEC removed this requirement,      allowing the Power Authority to fulfill it's 15% margin with      dirtier plants for an indefinite term.
Environmentalists claim that      this means dirtier plants for 30 years.
* As the energy crisis became headline news, the ISO 27 member      stakeholder board came under attack as an ineffective,      generator-driven body.
Replaced this year with a 5 member board      appointed by the Governor, the new ISO and DWR are now under attack      for sharing information and manipulating the wholesale market in      violation of federal law.
* In June the CPUC ordered the largest rate increase in history.
Since wholesale prices declined this summer, PG&E and SCE are      collecting more revenues than needed to cover current utility and      DWR costs.
If this trend continues, rates may be adjusted      downward, or revenues may be allocated to historical costs, such as      utility and DWR back debt.
* In September both PG&E and SCE submitted plans for payment of back      debt.
PG&E is waiting for bankruptcy court approval of the asset      transfer to its holding company, and SCE is fighting for it's rate      freeze deal on appeal from federal district court.
Legislators may      review the plans upon their return in January.
A LOOK BACK AT THE INTERRUPTIBLE PROGRAM  It was almost a year ago that blackouts plagued California, and businesses that operated under interruptible contracts felt the squeeze of repeated curtailments.
Dire predictions that the Summer of 2001 would be fraught with blackouts never came to pass, and a year later, the State continues to evaluate its energy infrastructure, supply and demand.
Still at issue is whether or not those businesses that did not opt-out of interruptible programs will be required to repay the fines and penalties that accrued between October 2000 and January 25, 2001.
Numerous requests to curtail, the threat of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines and penalties, and suspension of the opt-out window in November 2000, led to demands by the business community for the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to act to remedy the situation.
As a result, in January the CPUC suspended fines and penalties for failure to curtail under interruptible contracts and the programs temporarily were placed on hold.
In April, the CPUC issued Rulemaking 00-10-002 which, among other things, allowed businesses to opt-out or readjust their firm service level effective November 1, 2000 if they repaid the discounts received from November 1, 2000 through April 25, 2001.
These customers were not required to pay fines or penalties that accrued between those dates, however, they were prohibited from participating in any load reduction program that pays per kW for the remainder of 2001.
Customers also were allowed to opt-out or to adjust their firm service level effective the beginning of the first billing period after approval of this rulemaking and upon notification by the utility.
These customers were allowed to retain the rate discount for interruptible service through the date of any change in schedule or firm service level, but were required to pay any fines or penalties assessed for failure to interrupt during the period that fines and penalties were not suspended.
The CPUC has wrestled with how to address the substantial fines and penalties assessed on businesses, and yet still preserve the program such that businesses would comply when called upon in the future.
No CPUC solution would have made whole all businesses that participated in the program, and as expected, the CPUC decision affected each business differently.
It is rumored that the CPUC will revisit the fines and penalties provisions to see how businesses that substantially curtailed, but were required to repay the full discount were impacted, however, a specific hearing date has not yet been set.
Stay tuned for further developments.
SLOWING ECONOMY HAMMERS BAY AREA WORKERS Technology Sector Drives Job Losses  According to a just released report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, the economic downturn has resulted in 30,000 lost Bay Area jobs in just the last five months.
The breadth of the slowdown in the information technology (IT) sector has seriously begun to drag down employment in other sectors.
The Bay Area relies on high-tech for 32 percent of its wages and 11 percent of its jobs.
Business investment in IT products and software has slowed substantially this year, dampened by uncertainty in the national economy, dot-com and telecommunications crash, and over investment by business in IT products.
The abrupt slowdown in business investment in IT has had a noticeable impact on orders, shipments, and production among technology firms, resulting in declines in output and employment in these sectors, according to the report.
Softening markets for new office and industrial space have also dampened growth in construction employment this year.
Employment among providers of shipping, trucking, and warehousing services also fell in recent months, as firms scaled back in response to slowing demand.
BILL PROHIBITING ""ENGLISH-ONLY"" RULE MAY HINDER WORKPLACE SAFETY  The California Manufacturers & Technology Association (CMTA) opposed AB 800, a bill authored by Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City) and signed by Governor Davis.
The bill makes it an unlawful employment practice for an employer to limit or prohibit the use of non-English language in the workplace unless justified by an overriding business necessity.
The Fair Employment and Housing Act already prohibits an ""English-only"" rule with one exception.
An employer can require that employees speak only in English at certain times if the employer can show that the rule is justified by business necessity, and has effectively notified its employees of the circumstances and the time when speaking only in English is required, and the employees have been made aware of the consequences of violating the rule.
AB 800 not only provides the same protections; it goes into greater detail that is difficult for an employer to follow and it creates a trap for the unwary employer.
An employer may be sued if any step outlined in the bill is not followed exactly and could face both compensatory and punitive damages, plus a $5000 per worker statutory damage award.
No empirical evidence was presented indicating that current law was ineffective or that multiple monetary penalties were needed to deter employers from violating this provision of the law.
The bill may prove harmful to employees if it turns out that injuries or fatalities in the workplace begin occurring because safety and health rules are not being clearly communicated and understood by all employees and reinforced in a common language.
CMTA is also concerned that the bill may encourage more discrimination and harassment complaints by employees who believe they are the subjects of non-English conversations that could severely undermine employee moral.
AB 800 becomes law on January 1, 2002.
Employers who have ""English-only"" rules should review their rules to make sure that they are not in conflict with the bill.

DYN/ENE Deal Removes Overhang   We attribute last week's strong performance to indications of an imminent resolution to Enron's financial difficulties in the form of an investment from Dynegy.
Late on Friday, these reports proved true with Dynegy agreeing to acquire Enron and provide immediate liquidity support.
Over the last few weeks, the group came under pressure owing to concerns about Enron's deteriorating credit quality.
In particular, IPP investors were concerned about the level of receivables exposure of various companies to Enron.
Further, some industry observers suggested that a damaging reduction in trading liquidity could result if Enron were forced to withdraw from the natural gas and power markets.

Enron Receives Dynegy $1.5B Cash Infusion Tues. >DYN ENE By Christina Cheddar    11/14/2001  Dow Jones News Service  (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)    NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Dynegy Inc. (DYN) provided Enron Corp. (ENE) Tuesday with the $1.5 billion cash infusion envisioned in the companies' merger agreement, a Dynegy spokeswoman said.
Dynegy received preferred stock and other rights in an Enron unit that owns the Northern Natural Gas pipeline in return for its investment.
The cash infusion, which was made with the assistance of Dynegy's largest shareholder, ChevronTexaco Corp. (CVX), is aimed at providing Enron with additional cash liquidity to support its core energy marketing and trading operations.
The rights provide Dynegy with the option to acquire the pipeline unit should the two companies fail to complete their merger.
The deal, which still needs shareholder and regulatory approval, is expected to close within the next six to nine months.
Dynegy is acquiring Enron for 0.2685 of a Dynegy share, or about $10 billion based on the recent price of Dynegy shares.
The acquisition of Enron by its smaller rival follows a series of disclosures about Enron's financial dealings with partnerships run by some of its corporate officers.
The dealings are under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and at the center of more than a dozen of shareholder lawsuits.
During the last month, Enron watched as its share price sunk to a small fraction of its earlier levels as shareholder confidence in the trading company evaporated.
As credit-rating agencies began to cut Enron's debt ratings threatening the company's investment-grade status, the company scrambled to raise additional cash to shore up its balance sheet and protect confidence in its business.
Industry experts viewed Dynegy's cash infusion as one way the companies sought to bolster confidence in the energy trader's liquidity, and protect its most valuable business.
In a conference call earlier Wednesday, Enron said its core energy trading business has been temporarily hurt by the uncertainty created by recent events.
According to Dynegy spokeswoman Jennifer Rosser, the preferred stock Dynegy has received for its investment in Enron is convertible into the common stock of the Enron pipeline unit.
Dynegy also has the right to convert the preferred stock into Enron shares if it desires, the spokeswoman said.
For example, if Enron were to cancel its merger with Dynegy in order to accept a higher bid from another suitor, Dynegy might decide to convert its preferred shares into Enron stock in order to reap the profits created by an increase in Enron's stock price, Rosser said.
In either case, Dynegy wouldn't be required to pay any additional consideration.
Dynegy was able to make the cash infusion after ChevronTexaco, of San Francisco, made an investment in Dynegy.
If the acquisition closes as anticipated, ChevronTexaco, which owns about one-fourth of Dynegy, plans to make an additional $1 billion investment in the combined company.
ChevronTexaco also has the right to purchase an additional $1.5 billion in Dynegy stock in the first three years following the close of the acquisition.
Enron officials said they are monitoring the energy market's reaction to the cash infusion, and hopes it will restore the confidence of its counterparties.
Enron remains on a credit watch at the credit-rating agencies.
Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's each have Enron rated one notch above speculative grade.

For those investors that are interested in understanding how last week's tragedy might impact the sector we attached the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly and offer the following thoughts:  1.
Framework for Analysis   From a broader equity market perspective, the analytical challenge for investors is understanding how the prospect of slower economic growth will impact the outlook for corporate earnings.
Another area for analysis is understanding how the negative impact of a slowing economy will be offset by falling interest rates.
2.
Sector is Well Positioned Relative to the Market   On both fronts, we believe the power generation sector is well positioned relative to the broader market.
Compared to the rest of the market, the growth prospects for the industry are clearly less sensitive to economic conditions.
Providing support for this view, in 1991, when real GDP declined 0.5%, electricity demand increased 2.0%, which compares with a 2.2% annual growth rate from 1990-2000.
In addition, we believe the sector will benefit disproportionately from falling interest rates.

1821,"Jeff:  At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access program.
There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was modified by a changed version submitted by Pres.
Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01, the day before the last meeting.
This version indicated that direct access was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6) and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically naming that date.
This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.
The other item, Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.
Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on Sept. 20.
Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order dealing with the suspension date.
All that is required to make this change is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the Commission meeting.
Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the date to be altered under Commission procedures.
Please let me know if you require any additional information on this subject.

The following remains to be done:    1.
Prepare the application for rehearing and request for immediate stay.
This will be done by Douglass and will include new material not previously submitted (the commerce clause argument, a statement regarding the importation of power into California, the Senate Resolution of September 14, and the sealed declarations showing irreparable injury).

ORN Down on NYC Power Market Concerns; Con Ed Filing Indicates Intact Fundamentals   Orion Power traded off 14.6% owing to concerns surrounding the potential impact of the WTC tragedy on the New York City power market.
In particular investors are questioning the magnitude of lost power demand and the potential impact on the supply/demand balance in the region.
In an 8K filing issued yesterday, Con Ed notes that lost demand approximates 140 MW-30% below the low end of the initial range of estimates.
In addition, a portion of this demand will likely be relocated to other parts of the city.
Overall, Con Ed's filing gives us greater comfort in our conclusion that the fundamentals of the New York City power market remain intact.

The shippers have asked the Commission to (a) summarily determine that El Paso's mainline capacity is not adequate to serve its existing firm customers and (b) expeditiously establish a remedy phase in this proceeding.
Enron's answer reiterates the comments it filed in the original proceeding, namely that the Commission should consolidate this proceeding with the complaint filed in RP01-484 by the Joint Complainants (producers, California LDCs) which also deals with issues of adequacy of capacity.
We also reiterate and emphasize our original proposal that the Commission require El Paso to immediately give existing firm shippers the opportunity to turn back capacity they no longer need as one means of making additional capacity available to those who need more.

1833,"EXECUTIVE SUMMARY CPUC Terminates Direct Access PG&E/SoCal Bankruptcy Developments   Direct Access Despite the information that a CPUC representative responded favorably to a vote-delay request sent by the state's major business interests, and pressure to delay the vote from Governor Davis, the CPUC effectively terminated direct access in a 3-2 vote.
Our estimates regarding the votes of commissioners Brown, Wood, and Lynch did play out, as well as the CPUC's failure to pursue retroactivity for DA agreements.
The CPUC's move to carry forward the DA vote is not a complete surprise, as President Lynch has historically presided independently from pressure by Governor Davis.
Dismayed that the California Legislature was unable to offer resolution, Lynch and other commissioners felt obligated to provide direction and move the state forward in securing the State's economic base.
Note that DA agreements signed within the last three months may still be held under review by the CPUC, though no official word has yet been issued.
The CPUC also passed two measures that were preventing the progress of California's $12.5B bond sale.
There is still no clear date as to when these bonds will be issued.
SoCal/PG&E Bankruptcies  Mirant and Reliant (with Mirant leading the push) are reported have approached several entities as potential third parties for a creditors committee to take SCE into involuntary bankruptcy.
The City of Long Beach has been approached, but we believe Long Beach will use its leverage as a potential third party creditor to negotiate an independent deal with SoCal for payment of debt.
Orange County, Coram, and San Gorgonio Farms are also suspected to have been asked to sign the petition.
Contrary to rumor, it is not confirmed that Dynegy is considering joining Mirant and Reliant.
However, such a move by Dynegy ""would be logical"" and note that Dynegy funded, with Mirant and Reliant, recent polling research examining the public opinion effects of such a move.
Dynegy is reportedly discussing the possibility.
We are attempting to determine SoCal's response to the PG&E filing, the Mirant-Reliant effort, and to try to pulse the likelihood and timing of a voluntary bankruptcy petition.
Per earlier media reports, PG&E just announced it is filing three months early of a reorganization plan with the court.
We believe that the utility was motivated, in part, by its desire to scuttle any chance of a state MOU with SoCal in the third special session of the Legislature.
The reactions of key lawmakers (Burton, Bowen, Hertzberg, Keeley), and of course the Governor, will be important to watch.
The key elements of PG&E's plan include:   Assumes all responsibility for debt.
No state aid requested.
The utility will be split into two, with a distribution company remaining under CPUC regulatory authority and the native generation spun off into a new company free of CPUC oversight but regulated by FERC.
PG&E commits to provide 100% of its native generation to the State of California for 10 years at cost.
Cost of power includes both cost of generation (currently about 3.5 cents per kw/h) and cost of financing (estimated by our sources at 1.5 cents per kw/h).
All debt will be paid, with 90% of QF debt paid immediately and the remainder over a longer term.
Large generators will be ""substantially"" paid immediately and be asked to carry remaining debt over a longer term.
",California Update 9-20-2001
1834,"Done without much fanfare, except by Commissoner Wood, who continued his vitriolic attack on DA and took on green choice as ""fraudulent.""
The language in the order says no more DA contracts can be entered into after today.
The order directs the utilities to police the DASRs to make sure that none are submitted for contracts signed after today.
There is some strange language that talks about a possible future order to address the comments raised by the parties and putting parties ""on notice"" that, in this future order, they may suspend all direct access contracts signed on or after July 1, 2001.
Our attorneys are reviewing this, but on first blush, our California attorney says the CPUC would have a difficult time implementing a later retroactive suspension of DA.

In addition, none of the companies have any direct receivables exposure to SCE.

1838,"As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for ""Reporting of Natural Gas Sales to the California Market"" through the six-month emergency period that will expire on 1/31/02.
(Emergency reporting requirements are automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)
However, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the reporting requirements could be extended.
OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Information Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as part of its supporting statement (more specifically, ""include an explicit discussion"").
As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of the FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed collection of information.
We pointed out that we do not manage our business in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep our records in that manner.
We manage our business on an aggregated basis, and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significant manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale.
We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to the task.
The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requires FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the reporting requirements past 1/31/02.
(FERC indicated in its July order that it intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide with the end date of its mitigation plan.)
OMB questioned the practical utility of requiring disaggregated data when ""commenters"" reported that they did not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way.
OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant data manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation would likely be artificial.
OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden estimates after ""consulting with respondents"", and it must provide a list of the names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.
FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.
While we would not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be that the OMB action will affect their final decision.
At the least, it sends a signal!
",OMB Response to FERC Reporting Requirements
1839,"Susan,  I am pleased that the PUC demonstrated some level of propriety and common sense by not acting in a retroactive manner on direct access.
Accordingly, we are placing our work in abeyance pending further instruction.
If any party is interested in litigating further the direct access decision from September 20, it will be necessary to petition for rehearing at the PUC.
An aggrieved party will only be able to go to court if the PUC denies the petition for rehearing or upholds its original decision following rehearing.
The grounds for judicial review now appear to be limited to (1) denial of procedural due process and (2) PUC conduct contrary to law.
This latter argument is based on a statutory duty to hold hearings when deciding whether to change a policy originally decided following hearings.
Unlike the problems caused by a retroactive decision, there is probably no basis for a stay pending final decision.
The attached petition is the most recent generation and has fairly accurate tables of authorities and content.
It does not have the two most recent developments (the statement by the Department of Finance indicating that bonds may not be necessary and the argument that there was a statutory duty to conduct hearings).
If this petition is revived, those arguments can be quickly inserted.
I have also retained all comments so those will be available if the petition is revived.

Justin  California Takes Step to Reregulate Power By REUTERS AN FRANCISCO, Sept 20 (Reuters) ?
State utility regulators revoked the right of Californians to choose their power provider today, tossing out the centerpiece of the state's failed effort to deregulate its electricity industry.
The California Public Utilities Commission voted 3 to 2 to immediately suspend consumers' direct access to independent power retailers.
The move makes it easier for the state to use revenue from retail power sales to finance a record $12.5 billion bond issue this year.
The department was chosen in January to secure electricity for most of California's 34 million residents after soaring wholesale power prices drained the state's two biggest utilities of their cash and credit.
""Direct access is one half of a failed and collapsed deregulation project,"" a commissioner, Carl Wood, said today.
Mr. Wood said the other half of the problem was the law's retail rate cap, which blocked utilities from passing on the cost of power to customers, incorrectly assuming wholesale prices would fall.
When energy supplies tightened and prices soared, the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas and Electric Company , a unit of PG&E Corporation , and Edison International 's Southern California Edison had to absorb $13 billion in unanticipated costs.
Direct access was never a big hit.
Despite an $80 million advertising and public relations campaign to educate Californians about deregulation and retail choice, most customers stayed with their local utilities.
Big businesses and industrial customers, however, made deals with energy companies for cheap bulk power and wanted them to continue.
The utility commission estimated that 5 percent of the state's peak electricity demand of 46,000 megawatts is in direct access contracts.
About 10,000 businesses that signed new deals this summer, when wholesale power prices dropped, will be able to keep their contracts.

International Power was the weakest performer, declining 30.5%.
2.
Generation Oriented Utilities Fall 6.9%   Our universe of generation oriented utilities fell 6.9%, outperforming all the major market indices.
DTE Energy, which was down 2.7%, was the strongest performer in the group.
PPL was the weakest performer, declining 13.5%.
3.
IPPs Trading 24% Below Private Market Asset Value   Importantly, our analysis indicates that all the major US IPPs are now trading at or below the private market values of their assets.
As a group, the major IPPs are trading at a 24% average discount to their private market asset values.
NRG Energy and Reliant Resources are trading at the most significant discounts to their private market values-33% and 34%.
4.
Disparity Between Public and Private Market Valuations is Unsustainable We believe this situation is unsustainable and envision 3 scenarios that could play out.
1.
Stock prices may simply rebound correcting the valuation disparity; 2.
IPPs limit the amount of capital allocated to new plant construction and pursue share buybacks or acquisitions of other IPPs; or, 3.
Traditional utilities (both domestic and foreign) or other entities from outside the industry pursue acquisitions of IPPs.

The lower rates will be implemented under Kern River's previously approved extended-term rate program.
Williams, which developed a strategy to lower rates in response to customer requests as part of its rate-reduction settlement in 1999, projects more rate reductions next May, when the costs and revenues of the 2002 expansion are reflected in rates.
""The extended-term rate program was designed to provide long-term, firm shippers with an option to pay lower, more market-responsive rates today in return for extending their contract terms,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development.
Bruce Warner, manager of rates and planning for Tulsa-based Williams, said the company had looked at its ""financial situation and found that if customers could live with longer contracts, we could live with lower rates.
The lower rates will be offset by lower depreciation expenses and will not negatively impact Kern River's financial performance.""

1864,"Jeff,  I have attached a file showing the SCE receivable amount of ($109,292,004.75) Due Enron.
This amount is net of the payments made by SCE.
A few cautions, these amounts are reported more by Enron accounting month vs. utility bill cycle month.
But at least it highlights the rapid fall off starting in the March, when most of the customers had been returned to Bundled Utility Service.
To obtain a more accurate projection of the receivable as of January 18, 2001 or at any point would require this information be sorted differently and require allocation assumptions to handle the bill cycle vs. accounting vs. PX end date.
Hopefully this will be enough to get you ready for Monday's meeting.
Call me if you would like to discuss.
FYI, I have also included information re PG&E.
If you are asked, these amounts are directly from the utility bills, not an Enron's calculation.
We have not really tried to ""tie"" these numbers with the utility, but in all cases these amounts were pulled directly from the utility bills.
Any errors would be due to omissions or query compilation errors.
EES could be prepared to actually reconcile these with SCE, if you give the go-ahead to do so.
Let me know what you think, or if you need anything else.
If you follow Rick's suggestion, it might be a short meeting anyway.

1866,"Jeff:  Thanks again for all of your time and consideration with respect to our con= sideration of Norm Pedersen to join our Firm in Los Angeles.
I just wanted=  to let you know that we decided it probably did not make sense to pursue t= hings further with Norm.
After drilling down even further, it just seemed = like we were going to run into major conflict problems down the road based = upon the CA regulatory proceedings that likely are going to arise and the n= ature of Norm's historical client base.
It also would not have been fair t= o Norm to have him join the Firm and then be conflicted out of work that he=  had planned to pursue at the Firm.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate=  your candor as well as your open-mindedness in helping me evaluate the sit= uation.

I also want to emphasize emphatically (if it is possible to use = those words together!)
that I do not want you to think or feel that you ""ni= xed"" Norm or anything along those lines; indeed, I feel quite the opposite.=   In addition, from the outset, after first talking to Norm and getting a s= ense for the types of business he has been handling and the issues he has b= een pursuing on behalf of his clients, I had felt it was really a non-start= er since the last thing I wanted to do was to have LeBoeuf on the other sid= e from Enron in important regulatory proceedings for the company.

As Rick may have told you, there have been some situations where we have be= en adverse to the Company or at least representing clients that did not see=  ""eye to eye"" with Enron on all of the issues.
These generally have been s= ituations involving historical client relationships that go back decades wh= ere Enron has itself been using Bracewell, for example, and Rick has been i= ncredibly gracious and understanding in not conflicting us out of those pro= ceedings.

1868,"Hi all,  We spoke to Rick Simpson in Hertzberg's office who related the following:  The last meeting of Senate, Assembly, and Governor's staff was last Wednesday.
The Senate staff has been advised that the Governor is not interested in having a bill that could only pass the Senate.
He wants one that can get 41 votes in the Assembly as well, which means direct access would have to be included.
Rick spoke to Brian Kelly of Burton's office on Friday.
Brian said they are working on securitizing the interest costs.
They are looking at something like 50-60 kw for the core/non-core number which would still be able to be financed even with fewer customers, although the transaction costs would be higher with a smaller customer base.
I asked Rick if they expect all of their members to return and he said most of them would.
I suggested that it had better be the right ones, or they'd have trouble getting to 41 votes.
He said he wasn't sure at this point if a compromise bill could be ready by next Tuesday, but the Assembly is willing to try with the right bill.
I spoke to John Burton a few minutes ago who reiterated that he will not look favorably upon including direct access although he understands that some business democrats in the Assembly need it to vote for a bailout.
He said he spoke to an Assembly leader this morning who told him that even 78xx would get only 36 votes today if it came up for a vote (it squeeked through on 41).
He is considering putting up 78xx for a vote on Tuesday (it will fail) and continuing discussions with the Governor's office after that.
He said to tell you all that the bailout bill can't pass next week because it interferes with Scott and Gayle's wedding on the 14th, and coincidentally that is the last day for the Governor to sign or veto bills.

1877,"As you know, the Commission last week issued several important notices and papers regarding various policy initiatives that the Commission plans to address over the next few months.
These issues are extremely important to Enron and we have been urging FERC to address and resolve (most) of these issues for many years.
There is now a Commission in charge that looks like it is ready to act, and we need to be ready to respond.
In an effort to coordinate our efforts, we have developed coverage teams to respond to these FERC initiatives.
The Washington advocacy group will also work closely with all of these teams.
If someone is interested in a particular issue and was not included on that team, please feel free to call the Project Lead to have your name added to the team.
All assistance is welcome.
As you will see on the attached chart, many of the deadlines for responding to these initiatives are within the next few weeks, so the teams need to mobilize and establish a game plan for our responses very quickly.
On the attached chart, we have listed in the left column each of the FERC initiatives that will be starting or are currently underway.
A ""Project Lead"" has been named for each initiative.
The Project Lead will be responsible for developing and initiating a game plan for how Enron will respond in the proceeding.
The Team Lead will be contacting each of you within the next couple of days to set up processes and procedures for moving forward.
The team will be responsible for the initial determination of what issues should be addressed, what is the best way for Enron to respond to them, and producing draft comments.
Once draft comments are prepared, the comments will be circulated to a much wider group of Government Affairs and commercial people to ensure that the team has captured all of Enron's important issues.
There is a column of ""Inside Counsel"" and ""Outside Services.""
In some areas, we plan to use outside counsel or consultants and in others we do not.
Where we do not list outside counsel, we will rely on our inside counsel to draft the comments (with significant input from the team members).
Please remember, however, that even if outside services are listed, the RCR process must still be followed.
If applicable, Project Leads should submit the necessary RCR request as soon as possible.
The following is a brief description of each proceeding and the Project Lead named for each proceeding:  RTO Meetings and Comments to NOPR:  Sarah Novosel and Christi Nicolay will be the Project Leads in this proceeding.
The RTO meetings will be held in Washington from October 15-19, and we hope to have an executive from Enron make a presentation on one of the panels.
Comments will be submitted to FERC regarding the appropriate market design for RTOs.
This team will also be responsible for these comments.
Standards of Conduct NOPR:  Lisa Yoho will be the Project Lead.
Comments are due in approximately 45 days.
Several issues are raised in this proceeding, including a proposal to apply the standards of conduct to a utility's marketing affiliate buying and selling power to serve native load.
This is a significant action for FERC and we will strongly encourage the Commission to adopt this bold proposal.
ICAP Inquiry:  Christi Nicolay will be the Project Lead.
Chairman Wood has indicated that he is not very familiar with capacity and reserve requirements, whether they are needed, and what impact such requirements have on the market.
Enron has been a strong opponent of ICAP for many years, and we plan to show FERC that ICAP requirements are not needed.
We will submit expert testimony on this issue.
California Audit and Westwide Price Cap Mitigation:  Alan Comnes will be the Project Lead.
Commissioner Brownell is leading a FERC audit of the California ISO.
Although we do not have details of what the audit is intended to cover or how expansive it will be, we need to carefully monitor this proceeding and have input into the audit process where possible.
Furthermore, a request for rehearing is pending before the Commission regarding the current price cap mitigation measures.
The Commission implemented these caps in an effort to limit price spikes in California.
California's summer peaking season is over, but the Pacific Northwest's winter peaking season will be starting soon, and the mitigation measures currently in effect could discourage power sellers from selling power to the Northwest, where it will be needed this winter.
This team will be responsible for both of these proceedings.
Transmission Constraint and Energy Infrastructure Issues:  Steve Walton is the Project Lead.
FERC staff is studying two significant transmission constraints - California's Path 15 and the Central East Interface in New York  -- and plans to have the study completed later this year.
The Commission plans to forward the study to DOE.
The Commission stated that this is a high priority for it.
In a relating proceeding, the Commission has stated that it will hold four open meetings in different regions of the country to identify energy infrastructure issues.
The team will also oversee the progress in these proceedings.

1878,"On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs.
It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.
The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do).
After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action.

It is an update of the July 2000 report done at the request of House Energy Chairman Tauzin and Subcommittee Chairman Barton.
They requested the report be updated.
A summary of the report and the full 80+ page text is on the FTC web site at www.ftc.gov on the upper left side of the home page.
I read the summary and will read the balance.
So far, so good.
It basically says that even states that have opened up to retail competition are in transition with a hybrid of regulation and competition, thus the expected benefits of competition have not yet emerged.
However, the report states that nothing to date indicates that competition, once the transition period is over, will not produce additional benefits for consumers.
The report's major conclusion is that competitive wholesale markets are important to achieving effective competition in retail markets.
The summary includes something that sounds promising on RTO policy, saying ""And as wholesale and retail markets become regional, governing policies and jurisdictional approaches also must move in that direction for wholesale and retail competition to be successful.""

1887,"The Commission issued a draft decision yesterday (September 4) on DWR's revenue requirement.
While the Commission had been scheduled to vote on the revenue requirement at tomorrow's (September 6) meeting, the vote has been postponed to allow for comments on the PD.
Comments are due on September 11th.
Cmmr.
Lynch stated at her press conference held today that it  was her intent to vote on the PD no later than the next regularly scheduled Commission meeting on September 20th, and perhaps earlier if a continuation meeting can be scheduled.
The PD approves the entirety of DWR's requested revenue requirement of $12.6 less the costs of certain demand side management programs which are not included as ""authorized costs"" under AB1X.
The PD does not follow DWR's approach of a pro rata allocation of the revenue requirement among the three UDCs.
Rather the PD follows a ""cost of service"" approach.
The PD allocates DWR's energy procurement costs on a geographic basis, depending on whether the energy is delivered over facilities in northern California or Southern California (Transmission Path 15 is the line of demarcation).
Energy sources procured north of Path 15 are allocated to PG&E customers and those procured south of Path 15 are allocated to SCE and SDG&E customers.
The result of such allocation is to have 54% of DWR costs allocated to PG&E, 33% to SCE and 13% to SDG&E.
Each of the UDCs are then allocated the same percentage of bond proceeds.
In revenue requirement terms this means that for the period of January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002, PG&E is allocated $6.53 billion; SCE is allocated $4.01 billion and SDG&E is allocated $1.53 billion.
Along with the revenue requirement allocation, the PD adopts a DWR charge for each UDC.
The UDCs are directed to begin dispersing payment to DWR based on the relevant DWR charge for each kWh sold by DWR to the UDC's customer.
For PG&E this charge is 13.99 cents/ kWh; for SCE the charge is 10.03 cents/kWh; and for SDG&E the charge is 9.02 cents/kWh.
The PD also notes that given the fact that PG&E's DWR charge is  !3.99 cents it may need to remit to DWR an additional 4  cents for each kWh that was provided to its customers by DWR since June 1 until this order becomes effective.
As for the necessity of raising PG&E and SCE rates to account for the DWR revenue requirement, the PD states that such a determination cannot be made until a decision on the revenue requirement for the UDCs' retained generation is issued.
That proposed  decision is due out later this month.
If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order, please contact me.

How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of ""just and reasonable rates"" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs?
It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that.

It would be an understatement to say that the last year's worth events have been amazing at best.
As we discussed at lunch, Enron has developed a unique approach to QF contract restructuring.
The main premise is that of conducting a dual auction to determine, on a completely voluntary and open process, the QF buyout economics and the market clearing price for replacement energy.
As discussed yesterday, I am enclosing copies of the presentations made to PG&E and SCE on this topic.
I would be very interested in your feedback on this concept and on the presentations provided.
I must footnote that the economic shown in the presentations are Enron estimates.
Individual feedback, particularly in this area would be appreciated.
Jeff Dasovitch out of our SF office has been working with me on this proposal and will likely be contacting you within the next day to further discuss this idea as well as the benefits and possible strategies for  initiating such an auction process.

1896,"Since the Corporate Sponsors Reception is a new event, I am sure that you  have numerous questions.
Please feel free to call or email me directly  with any questions or concerns that you may have.
In hopes of anticipating some of your questions, I offer the FAQ below:  WHY IS THE EVENT IN BERKELEY, AND NOT SAN FRANCISCO?
I received 43 responses from students regarding the proposed location of  the event.
23 wanted to have the event at Haas, 20 wanted the event in  SF.
Since this was very close to a 50/50 split we also looked at the  number of students who have class on Tuesday evenings - approximately half  of the student body.
Given the simple majority of declared preference and  the desire to have maximum attendance, we chose the Haas location.
WHO SHOULD I INVITE?
We will be giving each student two invitations to extend to managers.
We  suggest that you invite your direct supervisor and your benefits/human  resources manager.
Please use your best judgement.
WHAT SORT OF TRANSPORTATION ASSISTANCE IS AVAILABLE TO MY MANAGER?
We will provide free parking to those who indicate that they will be  driving to the event.
If your manager is going to join you on the shuttle  bus from the South Bay, Peninsula or BART, you MUST tell us in advance so  that we can ensure adequate capacity for students and guests.
Shuttle buses  will run on their normal schedule - so managers using this option will  commit to spending a long evening on campus.
ARE TUESDAY CLASSES CANCELLED?
No, if you have class on Tuesday, please attend your class as usual.
The  reception will be during your class break.
Your managers can join you at  that time, either after attending the seminar, or having just arrived on  campus.
CAN I BRING MY MANAGER TO MY TUESDAY CLASS?
The program office is not opposed to this option, but you MUST tell us if  you intend to do so.
We will then be able to make sure that there are  enough seats for enrolled students and also that the faculty member does  not object.

1911,"Judge says Enron has to give up documents  By Emily Bazar Bee Capitol Bureau (Published Sept. 7, 2001)  Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive internal documents to state legislators, a Sacramento judge ruled Thursday, but only after the two sides agree to a court-approved confidentiality agreement.
For months, a special Senate committee investigating electricity price manipulation has been issuing subpoenas and gathering documents from power generators and marketers.
During the process, the committee has found three companies in contempt for resisting the subpoenas, including Enron, which fought back with a lawsuit asking the court to intervene on its behalf.
In his ruling stemming from the suit, Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi said he wasn't convinced that ""the Senate committee will be able to maintain the petitioner's right to confidentiality.""
As a result, he ruled, those documents handed over by Enron that contain legitimate trade secrets must be protected by a confidentiality agreement.
In his ruling on another Enron motion, however, he denied the company's request to quash the committee's subpoena.
Still, Enron officials considered the judge's findings on the whole a victory.
""We had no certainty that anything we handed over to the Senate would remain confidential,"" said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.
""We were not receiving due process from Senator (Joe) Dunn's committee.
They were acting as judge and jury on this issue.""
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who is the committee chairman, said he ""respectfully disagrees"" with the judge's decision on the confidentiality agreement, which he said will be reviewed in the next few days by the Legislature's lawyers to determine whether an appeal should be pursued.
Another Enron motion seeking an injunction against the committee will be heard in court next week.
Enron is one of three companies that have been found in contempt by the committee.
However, the committee purged its contempt finding against Mirant in July after the company complied with the committee's requests.
The committee was poised to expunge its contempt finding against Reliant Energy Inc. on Thursday as well but couldn't draw enough senators for a vote.
Dunn delayed the action until the next meeting.
As for the contempt charge facing Enron, the Senate Rules Committee is scheduled to review the findings Monday and possibly make a recommendation to the full Senate.
Should the full Senate also find Enron in contempt, it would determine what punishments, if any, would be levied.
Dunn said he believes fines would be the most appropriate punishment.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY ?
MOU Passes Assembly, Faces Fight in Senate ?
CPUC Direct Access Delayed by Senator  SoCal Developments As reported in the press this morning, the bailout passed the Assembly late last night by a 41-32 vote.
It will now head to the Senate, where very significant opposition is expected.
Along with his opposition to the changes made in the Assembly regarding the size of businesses that pay the dedicated rate component for the bailout, Senator Burton also has expressed privately that he is against paying twice book value for SoCal's transmission assets.
Senator Places Hold on CPUC Direct Access Vote Regarding the CPUC's decision to delay its hearings on the rate order and various other bond implementation measures (which led Treasurer Angelides to announce that the bond issue will have to be re-timed), this delay is due to a bill by Senator Burton that passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee yesterday.
Burton's bill would take the place of the current proposed rate agreement (from Governor Davis) and would require greater disclosure and transparency in DWR ratemaking, as well as separate the payment streams for the bonds from payment streams for power.
In doing so, Burton's bill preserves more PUC authority than would be preserved under the rate order currently before the PUC - thus the delay in action.
PG&E also supports Burton's bill, which is very likely to pass the Assembly and which the governor will likely have to sign.
If this bill is signed, PG&E's legal challenges to the DWR and PUC may be canceled.
The popularity of Burton's bill (as opposed to the rate agreement from the Governor) is leading many observers to conclude that Burton has replaced Davis as the most powerful, influential politician in California.
Burton's goal is to ensure that any direct access that is offered to large users in 2003 (when there will be a dip in power procurement by DWR, resulting in a net short) is only temporary and does not turn into a ""jail break.""
DWR's power procurement will rise again in 2004; Burton wants to ensure that businesses will have to return to purchasing power from DWR at that time.
The CTMA is opposed to Burton's bill and to the bailout if no direct access is offered.
The CTMA wants its members to be able to escape from buying power from the DWR (and therefore paying off the bonds) permanently in 2003.

",BA/E296.1 Questionnaire-due Oct. 25
1927,"Almost two years after issuing a decision in PG&E's GRC, the Commission issued it rehearing order on October 16th and, lo and behold, actually granted TURN's rehearing request in part.
The overall result is to reduce the capital revenue requirement by $24.8 million and expenses by $37.3 million.
In addition, some portion of PG&E' estimated $171 million in electric distribution capital spending will be subject to rehearing.
Listed  below are the areas in which the Commission granted rehearing.
1.
Electric Distribution Capital Spending.
The Commission will, in essence, reopen the record, and allow PG&E to put into evidence how much it invested in its electric distribution plant in 1998.
PG&E had used a 1998 forecasted amt of capital expenditures to develop its test year forecast.
TURN argued that there was substantial evidence on the record that this amount was never spent.
PG&E argued that the record closed prior to the end of 1998 so the best it could do was an estimate.
On rehearing, the Commission agreed with TURN, that there was evidence that the forecasted amount was never spent, so they are allowing PG&E to prove it.
The rehearing order states that any rates that are raised based on the electric distribution capital forecast adopted the GRC decision  may be subject to refund.
2.
Emergency Response Work This work category under electric distribution capital spending was reduced by $17.2 million.
3.
Vegetation Management.
The Supplemental Tree Trimming Program was reduced by $9.2 million.
4.
Meter Reading.
PG&E had primarily used accounting changes to justify the large increase in this service.
On rehearing the Commission stated that PG&E had failed to substantiate those changes and reduced the allowed amount by $7.9 million.
5.
Account Services.
On rehearing the commission stated that PG&E had failed to show (a) why it cost so much more to provide services to CIA customers  than residential customers ( $43.30 vs. $10.20); and (b) that money was not going for marketing activities that the Commission had disallowed in the previous GRC.
The result was that the commission disallowed $20 million.
6.
Customer Information Systems.
The Commission disallowed $7.2 million as funds which ratepayers had already expended for CIS  rewrites for which they had not received any benefits.

1929,"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.
No hand-outs were provided.
Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.
Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.
New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.
SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.
Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.
Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.
Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.
Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.
They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.
OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well.
Lots of complaints.
People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.
Eliminating point specific calculation.
Open system to Max Oper.
Limits or Contractual Limits.
Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.
No changes to Wheeler Ridge.
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.
If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.
Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .
No direct dial-up.
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.
However, can still make  changes.
Can still upload new files.
2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.
Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.
Gas Select is official notification.
Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.
Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.
OFO's can be declared intraday.
Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.
Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.
Don't want to go back and forth.
This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.
Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.
Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.
Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.
Generators need to revise expected usage.
Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.
Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.
Will allocate prorata.
Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.
In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut.
Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles.
For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.
Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.
For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.
For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.
; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.
Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.

1939,"HELP STOP THE SHIFT OF OVER $600 MILLION OF POWER COSTS FROM S. CALIFORNIA TO N. AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS.
Please call the PUC at 415 703 2074 to voice your opposition to this unfair plan.
Details and talking points are below.
*********** According to the California Public Utilities Commission's (CPUC) draft decision on the California Department of Water Resources?s (DWR) revenue requirement (attached), the CPUC is proposing to shift over $600 million of unreviewed DWR power costs to PG&E?s customers from Southern California customers.
If adopted by the CPUC, this would lock PG&E customers into 40-55 percent higher rates for DWR power over the next 10 years, compared to customers of Southern California Edison and SDG&E.
It discriminates against PG&E?s customers and has not been subject to public review, due process, or cost justification by DWR or the CPUC.
The CPUC has postponed the vote on the DWR cost shifting issue until later this month (Sept 20th, or sooner).
Without a full public hearing at which all the cost and ratemaking issues can be aired, Northern and Central California customers will not have a full and fair opportunity to review DWR ?s multi-billion dollar rate demands and will be unable to influence these proceedings.
The SVMG is strongly urging you to call the CPUC as well as your local legislators (contact information attached) to gain their support in opposing this unjustified and discriminatory rate shift.
Main issues of concern are: 1)the unfair shift of over $600 million in costs from SCE customers to PG&E customers; 2)imposes higher Direct Access exit fees in Northern CA.
than in Southern CA.
; 3)appears to fund a portion of SCE's debt repayment on the backs of PG&E customers without any justification from the CPUC (please find further talking points attached).
We are asking that the CPUC conduct open public hearings so that public comment can be provided, and the DWR's basis for cost recovery can be reviewed.

1953,"<<IPW091001.doc>>  Good Morning,  Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.
Also note that today and tomorrow (9/10 and 9/11), CSFB will host a Power Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.
This event is designed to provide investors with a wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas companies, to equipment and service providers, to the power producers themselves.
The major power generators are scheduled to speak on Tuesday morning (9/11).
Between 9.25 am - 11.50 am presentations will be given by the following companies: Aquila, Calpine, Mirant, NRG Energy, Orion Power, Reliant Resources and TECO Energy.
In addition, at 8 am on Tuesday there will be a panel discussion focusing on the state of the generation market.
Finally, at 12 pm on Tuesday Judah Rose a power market consultant with ICF Consulting will offer his perspectives on the outlook for the sector during a luncheon presentation.
Summary: 1.
IPPs Fall 3.7%   Last week our IPP composite declined 3.7%, outperforming both the NASDAQ (-6.5%) and the S&P 500 (-4.2%).
Shaw Group, which was up 14.4%, was the strongest performer in the group.
AES Corp was the weakest performer, falling 10.7%.
2.
Awaiting a Bottom   We attribute last week's stock price performance to broader market concerns regarding the health of the macro economy and its ability to recover by the end of 2001.
Our sense is that investors recognize that IPP valuations are extremely attractive.
However, prior to moving aggressively back into the sector, they await some indication that stock prices have stabilized and a bottom has indeed been achieved.
3.
Shell Terminates Contract with CPN; Concerns Unwarranted   Following its exit from the retail marketing business, Shell terminated a 5 year 3,000 MW requirements contract with Calpine.
We believe some investors concluded that this announcement had negative implication for CPN's earnings outlook and its overall hedging strategy.
In our view these concerns are unwarranted for 4 reasons: 1.
The Shell contract was unusual; 2.
There is no earnings impact; 3.
Remarketing the output will not be an issue; and, 4.
The status of CPN's hedging objectives is unaffected.
4.
Legal and Administrative Issues Remain for California Windfall Profits Tax Bills   Recently, two bills that would impose a windfall profits tax on California generators have been advancing through the California legislature and will likely by heard on the floor of the Assembly this week.
The current legislative session will end this Friday (9/14), requiring any pending bills to be passed by that time.
In our view these bills are best understood as a negotiating tactic by Governor Gray Davis and Democrats in the legislature designed to extract additional concession from the FERC and the state's power generators.
While we expect at least one or both of these bills to advance through the legislative process, full implementation is likely to be prevented by a number of legal and administrative impediments.

1956,"Jeff and Sue:  The Governor proposed the following energy-related budget cuts today:  Biomass Grant Program - Revert $5.5 million of the $11.5 million budget back to the General Fund.
The program provides grants to operators of biomass plants to offset loses.
Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Fund - Revert $29.9 million back to the General Fund.
The program would have required the Trade and Commerce Agency to guarantee loans made by financial institutions to eligible businesses for the permitting, manufacturing, acquisition, construction, or installation of renewable energy systems that are intended to decrease demand on the grid.
Powerwalk Program - Revert $3.2 million of the $20 million budget back to the General Fund.
The program requires the Conservation Corps to distribute energy efficiency information and light bulbs in low income communities.
Agricultural Peak Demand - Revert $29.4 million of the $86.3 million budget back to the General Fund.
The program requires the state to provide grants to the agriculture industry to install energy efficient hardware.
Expedited Siting Applications - Revert $3 million back to the General Fund.
The program would have aided local governments by enabling them to hire additional consultants to review siting applications.
Power Plant Construction Bonuses - Revert $14 million of the $20 million budget back to the General Fund.
The program provided bonuses to power plant owners who got their plants on-line within a specified time period.
Renewable Energy Program - Revert $24.9 million of the $25 million budget back to the General Fund.
The program would have required the state to establish a renewable energy program to provide financial assistance to public power entities, independent generators, utilities, or businesses manufacturing renewable energy generation components or systems, or both, to generate new and renewable energy sources.
Oil and Natural Gas Pumping - Revert $9.6 million back to the General Fund.
The program would have provided for energy efficiency audits of various oil and natural gas facilities.

1966,"On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan for implementing the suspension of direct access.
Parties have until, Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.
The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seek Commission approval:  1.
A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESP List submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.
2.
In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC Service Agreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers, they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20, 2001.
3.
For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customer account, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third party verification took place prior to September 20, 2001.
4.
Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another after September 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in place on or before Sept. 20th.
5.
Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.
6.
For customers on bundled service as of September 20, 2001 (but still under a DA contract), the UDCs are proposing not to allow such customers to process DASRs even if their names are on the October 5 list.
7.
If all  accounts of one ESP transferred to another as a result of a merger, then the situation is okay because no new DASR would be required; requests for one customer to switch from one ESP to another only allowed if the new ESP-customer relationship had a contract prior to Sept. 20, 2001.
8.
Changes in customer identity allowed on  case by case basis (e.g., if a customer changes its type of business it would not be allowed).
9.
One  customer can not transfer or assign its direct access service rights to another.
10.
Processing of DASRs submitted for customers who attempt to opt into a community aggregation program after the suspension date should not be allowed.
In addition to the above, the UDCs proposed three additional options for implementing the suspension.
1.
The Commission should impose a DASR cut-off date (received and accepted).
2.
If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it should require that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut off to submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to the Commission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible to receive DA.
The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okay from the Commission.
3.
The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR was associated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs set forth a proposed affidavit.)
If you have any questions, please call  Jeanne

was very good and will be remembered for the positive difference that we have all made in the industries in which we have worked and for each other.
We even had a good time doing it.
The good work we do will go on for many, if not, all of us .

The advice letter provides the structure and operation of the PROACT, The beginning balance of the PROACT will consists of the unrecovered procurement related obligation as of September 1, 2001.
Beginning on Sept. 1, on a monthly basis, the following amounts will be recorded in the PROACT: (1) SCE's Surplus (recorded revenues minus recoverable costs); (2) all refunds related to procurement related liabilities; (3) securitization proceeds, (4) interest expense.
The advice letter provides a detailed explanation as to how SCE's surplus and recoverable costs will be calculated.
In addition, the advice letter addresses settlement rates.
SCE notes that, under the Settlement, the Commission agreed to maintain electric retail rates for retail customers at no less than the Settlement Rates during the Repayment Period.
Settlement Rates are defined in the Settlement as "" gross electric retail rates (including surcharges)"".
In its advice letter, SCE proposes to define gross electric retail rates to mean the system average rates.
By defining it that way, the Commission can change the revenue allocation between rate groups, as well as effect some rate increases/decreases in certain rate components as long as such revisions do not result in a change in SCE's system average rates.
SCE has asked for a September 1, 2001 effective date for the advice filing.
Under standard procedures, protests on the filing would be due December 4th.
SCE has asked for an accelerated schedule of November 28.
To date, as far as I am aware, it has not been granted.

1990,"Jeff: I've spoken with Keith and Dan and have put in calls to Evie and Bill.
We're all trying to figure out what to do and how to approach the CPUC.
In Enron's letter to President Lynch and the utilities, Enron's states that ""we plan to submit within the next week DASRs to the utilities to effect the return of a portion of our customer base to bundled utility service and to transition some of our other customers to alternative ESPs at the request of such customers"".
Since the letter was dated this Monday, Dec. 3, that means Enron - as of Monday - was going to start de-DASRs or switches to new ESPs by next Monday, Dec. 10, or even earlier.
Is Enron still on this accelerated time schedule for switching to new ESPs or de-DASRs?
I read this to mean Enron will literally exist the direct access market for all its customers no later than Monday, Dec. 3.
Was something else intended?
Has this schedule slowed down at all?
I think that if the CPUC believes Enron is really leaving by Monday, it is just going to do nothing.
What should I tell the CPUC re Enron's schedule?
Thanks,

1992,"Business&Finance: ESB ownership of network is questioned - Competition  Authority says separation of national grid from core company does not go far  enough.
Arthur Beesley reports     11/13/2000  Irish Times  18  Copyright (C) 2000 Irish Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)   The Competition Authority has questioned the ESB's ownership of the  electricity network in the newly deregulated power market.
In a paper submitted to the Department of Public Enterprise, the body said  the separation of the ESB's National Grid operation from the core company did  not go far enough to ensure fair competition.
It said arguments in favour of the ESB retaining the transmission and  distribution system ignored the 'overwhelming conclusion' that a generation  company which owns such assets 'will naturally favour itself' at the expense  of customers and reliability.
The paper has not been published yet.
It is believed to state, however, that  the ESB's retention of its 'non-competitive' transmission and distribution  assets and its 'competitive' electricity generation business was unwise from  a competition perspective.
The National Grid, which controls when individual power stations feed  electricity into the network, was separated from the ESB when 27 per cent of  the market was opened last February.
In theory, this meant the ESB could not favour its own generation stations  over more efficient competitors when deciding which plant to switch on and  off as demand for power fluctuates.
But the authority's response to the Statutory Instrument behind the  separation - which renamed the National Grid as Eirgrid - said more should be  done to ensure the market operates fairly.
The paper said: 'Some argue that as long as there is an independent operator  of the underlying transmission system, ownership of the transmission system  can remain in the hands of an upstream generation operator.
'In accordance with this line of argument, the shift of operational control  of electricity transmission to Eirgrid would mean that discrimination in  dispatch [of power] and other operations would not be possible.
However, the  Competition Authority considers that this argument ignores the overwhelming  conclusion that the generation company that owns the transmission lines will  naturally favour itself.'
The Statutory Instrument followed complex talks, which led to an agreement  between the ESB, its trade unions and the Minister for Public Enterprise, Ms  O'Rourke.
When Eirgrid was formed, the ESB retained ownership and responsibility to  develop and maintain the high-voltage national transmission system and the  low-voltage local distribution network.
The authority says these, too, should be separated from the ESB to ensure the  competitive market functions fairly, according to a person familiar with its  paper.
This would ensure equal access to the power network and an objective,  transparent, non-discriminatory treatment of all electricity generators in  the market, it said.
The paper argues the ESB has an incentive to allocate as many costs as  possible to the operation of the transmission and distribution system.

2006,"PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.
As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the  past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's  electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small  customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States  Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to  achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in  California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from  the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, ""core"" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the  utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers  would go to market.
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close  devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the  utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January  and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR  contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore  structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the  contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large  customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR  contracts.
Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to  address ""the DWR contract problem"" in order to prevent the contracts from 1)  killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure  focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not  include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any  ""out clauses"" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract  provisions.
(My cursory review of the contracts suggests that ""outs"" for the  state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might  reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear  that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally  abrogate anyone's contract rights.
We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some  options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the  core/noncore solution alive.
We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM  PDT.
Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let  me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

2014,"Hertzberg (speaker of the CA Assembly) called a meeting yesterday afternoon  of the group of market participants that have been negotiating the  ""core/noncore"" proposal in California.
The purpose of the meeting was to  brief us on their activities and their gameplan for trying to find a solution  for California.
Here's a summary of the meeting.
Please keep confidential.
Work will be done over the weekend to put the core/noncore proposal in  legislative language.
(We will be in the room.)
Work done by the ""Plan B"" group in the Assembly (Joe Dutra and Joe Nation)  will also be put into legislative language over the weekend.
Because no proposal is ""comprehensive,"" a complete legislative package will  be created from the various pieces that have been worked on thus far (i.e.,  core/noncore, ""Plan B,"" Edison MOU) In addition, there are Republican demands that Hertzberg will need to address  (e.g., end the litigation) in order to achieve bi-partison support, which is  what Hertzberg's shooting for.
To move the legislation, the plan is to establish a ""conference committee,""  comprised of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans.
The committe would begin work on Monday and would attempt to finish putting a  comprehensive bill together, vote it out of the Legislature and send it to  the Governor for signing by Monday, July 16th.
July 16th is the deadline because that is the date that the PUC will issue  its proposed decision regarding, among other things, how DWR's revenue  requirement will be put into rates, whether Direct Access needs to be  suspended, etc.
The PUC is issuing the draft on the 16th in order to give everyone 30 days to  review and comment before the Commission votes on a final order on August  15th.
(The PUC will actually issue a ""thought piece"" on Monday the 9th and  will use reactions to the ""thought piece"" to craft the develop the proposed  decision it plans to issue on the 16th.)
All of this is still up in the air, however.
As of right now, the leader of  the Senate (Burton) has not agreed to Hertzberg's gameplan and the  Republicans, while interested, have not yet committed to join the process.
",California Update--Legislative Push Underway
2015,"USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E utility gives Calpine debt priority status.
07/06/2001 Reuters English News Service (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
(changes 1st paragraph, adds details, company statement)  SAN JOSE, Calif., July 6 (Reuters) - Independent power generator Calpine  Corp. said on Friday that its contracts with Pacific Gas and Electric Co.  will be altered, ensuring that Calpine will continue to supply power to the  bankrupt California utility and that it will get paid more than $250 million  for power already sold.
Calpine stocks rose more than 14 percent, or more than $5, to $43 after the  announcement.
As part of the contract modification, the $267 million, with interest, that  the utility, a unit of PG&E Corp , owes Calpine in past due receivables under  the contracts, will be elevated to ""administrative priority status,"" a claim  which is paid before any other general unsecured creditors.
Calpine will get the money, in a lump sum, as soon as PG&E has a confirmed  reorganization plan, which can take as long as four to six months from now,  Calpine said.
The move is also a step in the process of untangling California's energy  crisis, which stemmed from a flawed deregulation plan that has hit the state  with a series of rolling blackouts.
Under the agreement, Calpine will continue to receive its contractual  capacity payments, but it has also set up a fixed rate contract for the next  five years of about 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The contracts are known as qualifying facility contracts because Calpine's  power plants are qualifying facilities.
These types of facilities represent  more than 20 percent of the state's power supply and sell power generated  from renewable energy sources to the regulated utilities.
""Calpine is the first power company to modify its QF contract with PG&E to  ensure that Northern California consumers will continue to benefit from these  affordable and reliable energy resources,"" Calpine senior vice president  James Macias said in a statement.

The group negotiating the core/noncore proposal met over the weekend to  attempt to put the proposal into legislative language/format.
The product produced thus far is generally sloppy and ill-drafted and the  individual facilitating the group is working tonite to integrate the comments  provided and discussions that took place today.
He will  distribute a new  draft by noon tomorrow (PDT).
The plan as it currently stands is to deliver a product to Hertzberg by COB  tomorrow (Monday).
As expected, some in the group are attempting to ""recontract"" certain  portions of the original deal, but those attempts are generally at the margin.
The DWR contracts remain a key impediment to any deal.
Senator Burton has still not definitively committed to a conference committee  to produce a bill to deliver to Davis.
In addition, the legislation to create a dedicated rate component to service  the bonds to repay the state budget for power purchased by DWR (and de-link  the bonds from the DWR contracts) may be on a slower track than folks thought  initially.
Will have more information tomorrow on where Burton and the bond legislation  stand.

The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to  go along.

2025,"Talked to Dave.
In a nut shell, here are the problem areas in the bill as he  sees it.
It was a very brief conversation, but I think I've captured the key  points: Based on an expectation that the ""expedited siting"" bill would help site  plants, Dave's group had six plants on the drawing board.
The 5 ppm requirement kills 4 of the 6, i.e., the 4 can't meet the 5 ppm  requirement.
The requirement that the plants would either be 1) shut down after 3 years or  2) replaced with a combined-cycle plant kills the other 2 because a) shutting  down the plants in 3 years kills the economics, and b) the sites for the two  LM-6000s can't accomodate combined cylces (i.e., Dave couldn't get siting).
In addition,the generator would be required to sign an exclusive with the ISO  (which the EOB would have to approve), which takes away the optionality of  going to the market, thus killing the economics.
On the labor side, it's complicated, but in essence, by requiring that ""...it  be shown that the applicant has a contract with a general contractor and has  contracted for an adequate supply of skilled labor to construct, operate, and  maintain the plant,""  it forces Dave to negotiate a labor deal before he knows what the project is  (i.e, before the project has been approved), and, it effectively prevents Enron from having the option to use internal  resources (this issue is very specific to Enron; I can explain more if folks  prefer).
In short, bullets 1-3 would seem to affect both Enron and the market, while  the last bullet is, according to Dave, very Enron specific.
Point 2 in  bullet 4, according to Dave is sensitive and should not be made public.
If any questions, let me know.

2026,"Please forward to others who need this information.
As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small  customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal  that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.
Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the  MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.
The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not  yet been completed.
The URL for the bill is attached.
Based on a meeting  attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is  attached) are:  Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on  the effective date of the bill) Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by  customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the  generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits,  investigations, etc.)

2040,"Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for  years (Published July 24, 2001)  The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more  intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee  sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn  over internal documents.
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has  adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple  investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high.
And it has  become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted  criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay.
""I would love  to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a  tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' "" Lockyer said.
With  less colorful language, Gov.

",Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will  continue for years
2041,"Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly  members back.
So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make  a run at this.
We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.
Some key considerations:  The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something  done.
The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having ""done  nothing.""
Becauase the Assembly has thus far ""done nothing,"" the only thing it has in  front of it is 78.
The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill  was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided.
So there's a  reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order  to get the support necessary to get voted out.
Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where  the Senate would have to approve it.
Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and  call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that  Burton's inclined to come back.
In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes  to 78, that ""it's 78 or nothing.""
Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e.,  Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's  amendments.
Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye  on the issues.
All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be  counted out.
We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could  move.
Will report back as information becomes available.

",Rumor That The Legislature May Reconvene
2042,"Adding to Kristin's update, here's the summary of a meeting that just occured  with Assembly leadership staff and industry on the Assembly's latest version  of an ""Edison MOU"":  The Speaker's staffer said that if he had to bet at this time, he would bet  that the Assembly would not convene on Friday.
He also said that, if it doesn't happen on Friday, nothing will happen until  they get back from recess on the 20th of August.
The Assembly will let folks know by tonight or first thing tomorrow whether  they intend to move forward with a vote on Friday or recess.
From the most recent proposal released today by the Assembly leadership, it  appears that the centrist Democrats are prevailing.
The proposal: Retains Direct Access (though they said that they are continuing to be  pressured by the Treasurer, who wants DA suspended due to the bond issuance) Places 80% of Edison's past debt with large customers (leaving 20% with small  customers, which business customers or strenuously opposing).
Eliminates all references to any purchase, or option to purchase, Edison's  transmission.
(They said there simply ain't the votes to buy, or consider  buying, Edison's transmission in the Assembly) Maintains the Senate provision, which would pay the banks, pay the QFs, but  place with Edison the risk of figuring out how to pay the $1billion owed to  suppliers.
(Even the munis are begining to complain about those provisions.)
Creates a tradeable, renewable portfolio standard (conceptually similar to  the one created in Texas).
The new bill is created by 1) amending SB78 and 2) gutting a different bill  passed from the Senate to the Assembly, SB39, and replacing it with the new  version of 82XX.
The two would go together to create the Assembly's newest  proposal.
If this bill gets voted out of the Assembly, it will likely have a difficult  time getting the votes necessary to pass in the Senate, since the Senate has  considered and rejected several provisions currently included in the Assembly  version.
Will report back on whether the Assembly's going forward or adjourning for  recess as soon as we hear.

",Davis spokesman under fire for stock
2046,"Gouger Gray Davis  California's petulant governor ignores reality as he overpays for electricity  LANCE T. IZUMI Mr. Izumi is a senior fellow in California Studies at the San  Francisco- based Pacific Research Institute.
On the surface, things seem to be going pretty good for Gov.
Gray Davis with  regard to California's electricity crisis.
The governor has scored some nice  publicity by switching on some new power plants.
The weather has been  unseasonably cool.
His poll numbers are edging back up.
Yet beneath this  optimistic picture lie troubling problems.
For example, Davis's argument that  out-of-state power generators are responsible for the electricity crisis has  been falling apart.
For months, Davis has been claiming that private  generators have overcharged California by $8.9 billion and demanded that this  amount be refunded to the state.
However, after a two-week mediation between  state officials and the generators, Curtis Wagner, the federal government's  chief energy regulatory judge, rebuked Davis's claim saying that such a huge  overcharge ""has not and cannot be substantiated.""
Further, while the  generators may be liable to refund a much smaller amount to the state,  perhaps $1 billion, Wagner said that generators are owed more money by the  state than they owe the state in refunds: ""Can a cash refund be required  where a much larger amount is due the seller?
The chief judge thinks not.""
Davis reacted to the judge's ruling by calling it a ""raw deal"" and by urging  the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ignore the lack of evidence and  the judge's conclusions and to ""step up and provide the refunds we've asked  for.""
Davis's position, as usual, is motivated purely by politics.
Indeed,  Dan Walters of the Sacramento Bee says that Davis is operating in a  ""melodramatic virtual world"" de-linked from reality.
Davis's blame-the-generators argument took another body blow when newly  released documents showed that, on average, major out-of-state power  companies such as Enron, Duke, Dynergy and Mirant charged less than the  average prices paid by the state during the first three months of the year.
California government utilities, on the other hand, such as the Los Angeles  Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District  (SMUD), charged the state much more for electricity than the out-of-state  generators.
For example, while Texas-based Enron, a favorite Davis whipping  boy, charged an average $181 per megawatt hour, SMUD charged an average $330  per megawatt hour.
Davis responded to this revelation in typical political fashion.
A Davis  spokesman said that the governor had expressed his anger at ""the generators  who wear cowboy hats"" and that ""just because there are other entities that  are charging us more doesn't change the fact that we are getting ripped off  by companies from Houston, Tulsa, Atlanta or Charlotte.""
Yet, for all Davis' feigned indignation about consumers being ripped off, it  turns out that he and his regulators are poised to ensure that business  consumers are ripped off by state government.
Davis has signed $43 billion in  ill-advised long-term purchase contracts at rates above-market-price.
The  state must, therefore, ensure that enough business customers remain in the  current state-controlled distribution system to pay for high-priced state  power purchases.
This is especially important to Davis since the high prices  are borne disproportionately by business.
Thus, Davis' regulators are set to  eliminate ""direct access,"" which allows businesses to shop for cheaper power.
Who's the real gouger?
No matter how much Davis points the finger,  Californians are paying dearly for his political opportunism and bad  policies.

2055,"Distributed Power: The Next Big Investment?
With today's electricity demand expanding beyond the reach of available  supply, and nationwide electric deregulation efforts providing inconsistent  results, distributed power just may be the next big thing, according to Bear  Stearns analyst Robert Winters.
With technology-laden, electricity-hungry companies popping up every time you  turn around, and blackouts and brownouts occurring more frequently as large  power grids are becoming less reliable, the analyst points towards  distributed energy services as a possible solution, and maybe the ""next big  investment opportunity for the coming decade.""
In Winters' 250 page report,  ""Distributed Energy Services-The World's Power and Transportation Industries:  Set for a Revolution-Part 2,"" he examines technologies and companies within  the distributed energy services sector that might be able to take advantage  of the current situation.
""Thanks to major technological advances and energy deregulation, a wave of  new investment in the power industry has just begun.
We believe that this  coming era in the power industry could resemble the wave of investments which  flooded into the telecommunications industry following the breakup of AT&T in  the early 1980's,"" said Winters.
""Companies and municipalities need to find ways to ensure the availability of  high quality, reliable power,"" added Winters.
According to his research,  microturbines are the best positioned of the ""new"" technologies that would be  able to have an immediate impact on electric generation.
He based his recommendation on the fact that microturbines are small, quiet,  efficient and very versatile.
""They can be used as a main power source, a  back-up power source or as an alternative when there is a spike in  traditional energy prices,"" the analyst said.
""Microturbines can also be used  in remote locations, including developing countries, that do not have access  to electricity.""
Another attractive feature of microturbines is their fuel  requirements.
The units often use natural gas, but can also use several other  fuels as well.
In the study, the analyst also examined fuel cells, flywheel technology, and  existing reciprocating engines technologies such as diesel engines and  Stirling engines, which he noted are enjoying a comeback.
In addition to the report, Winters initiated coverage on two distributed  energy companies.
He labeled Active Power, a company that is pioneering  flywheel technology, as a ""buy"" and Capstone Turbine Corp., a leading  manufacturer of microturbines, as ""attractive.""
The companies are in addition  to two fuel cell companies he currently follows.

2060,"Paul:  Here's additional info for the ""curtailment"" data that we're pulling  together.
Utility Pricing for Core Gas Customers  Prior to the month in question, the utility forecasts gas prices based on  NYMEX monthly prices.
So for example, based on November's forecast, the  utility sets prices to be charged to core consumers in December.
When December's over, the utility compares forecast prices with actual  prices.
If the forecast was too low, and there's an undercollection, the  utility will increase January's price forecast by ""just enough"" to make up  for the December undercollection.
If prices were too high and there's an  overcollection, the utility will reduce January price forecast by just enough  to refund the overcollection.
If the overcollection/undercollection is very large, the utilities have  generally spread out the ""true-up"" over several months to avoid ""rate shock""  one way or the other.
However, under the current circumstances, the  utilities may be less willing to spread it out, and may wish to recover the  entire undercollection in the following month.
In short, there's at least a  one-month lag in customer prices to account for differences in forecasts  versus actual.

2063,"FYI.
As you know, we're attempting to find a solution to the ""reasonable  review"" morrass that's impeding utility forward contracting.
For that  effort, we've worked with the Portland desk to pull together some educational  materials to use with a subset of California stakeholders that's trying to  devise a solution to California's melt down.
The attached graphs show 3 scenarios for the state as a whole.
1) ""do nothing""   2) for 60% of IOU short position, split the amount 50-50 and 1cover half the  amount with 10-year  fixed priced power and the other half with 5-year fixed  priced power.
3) create a portfolio with a) 25% of short position covered by 10-year fixed  priced power, b) 20% of short position covered by 5-year fixed price power,  c) 15% covered by 1-year fixed price power, d) 20% covered by May-Sept  fixed-price power, and e) 15% from the PX.
The term of each scenario is 5 years.
Because each is priced off our our curves, the average price is roughly  equivalent for each of the three portfolios.
However, the graph shows (as  one would expect) that exposure to price volatility is significantly higher  under scenario 1 compared to 2 and 3.
The goal is to use the illustrative scenarios to persuade the industry that  in the short run (i.e., immediately) the utilities should be permitted to buy  a modest amount of power under 5 and 10 terms, and those purchases (if  undertaken using a ""DealBench-like"" tool) ought to be ""per se"" reasonable.

After some discussion about whether  5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its  proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.
(Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.)
Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive.

2070,"Lara:  I have rather hastily put this list together.
For that I apologize.
Hope it is helpful.
The things on the list are ones that you've likely  already considered.
Nevertheless, some of the issues we face in California  include:  1.
POWER PLANTS The utilities' subs are building power plants; competitors (like Enron) are  also trying to develop plants to sell power into both wholesale and retail  markets.
The utilities control the interconnection of plants to the grid.
The interconnection rules are currently so vague and ambiguous, that the  utility could quite easily favor its generation sub over competitors.
This would have an effect on prices at both the wholesale and retail level  (i.e., how do we know we've gotten the best generation deal if the utility  can favor its subs plants via interconnection?).
2.
DISTRIBUTED GENERATION And the same goes for DG:  in California many are pointing to DG as a viable  solution to the price spikes.
If the utility loses sales because a customer has installed DG on her  premises as a hedge against price spikes, the utility will have an incentive  to thwart interconnection of the DG unit.
(Recall that in many places,  recovery of distribution costs is derived from kwh sales; and if sales go  down, so can recovery of the utilities' distribution-related costs).
In addition, if someone attempts to install DG at the grid level (as opposed  to on-site DG) and sell the DG power in wholesale and retail markets, the  utility has the ability to frustrate the DG project via interconnection.
This permits the utility to retain bundled service customers.
Utility  control of DG Interconnection can also permit the utility to favor its DG  subs.
3.
INTERCONNECTION/VOLTAGE BUY-UP And the same goes for the retail level---remember how SDG&E used

2074,"John/Gia:  You asked that we attempt to evaluate our activities.
Working with TW, I've  valued this one.
The California Commission ruled that the ""Hector Road"" natural gas recent  point in California ought to be made a primary receipt point.
This would  have had the effect of TW losing access right to 200 MMcf/d of capacity at  SoCalGas' Needles receipt point.
Best case scenario:  Under SFV rates, loss to TW is commodity rates (wash)  and the fuel margin.
TW calculates the fuel margin to be $5.8MM/yr.
Bad case:  If shippers on TW try to make the case that TW is at fault for  losing the primary access rights, then TW is at risk for the demand component  of the contracts associated with the 200 MMcf/d.
TW calculates the demand  charges loss to be $16.5 MM/yr.
Worse case:  In addition to actual damages listed above, shippers face  performance penalties and other contractual damages (from their customers)  and they try to pass those costs on to TW.
I discussions with TW, we concluded that the most likely case fell between  ""best"" and ""bad,"" somewhere in the $12-15MM/yr range.
TW believes that without the assistance of CA Gov't Affairs in the case, the  $12-15 MM/yr would have been lost.

Edison threw new  demands on the table that effectively ended any chance for a deal today.
Appears that at this point that anything more than a 10% rate increase is out  of the question politically for the Governor, and the utilities are very  unhappy about it.
Consumer groups are already balking publicly at the 10%  increase reported in the press.
The meeting effectively ended when Edison announced that, in response to New  West turning back their customers, Edison plans to file a proposal with the  Commission this week that would require all returning customers to pay the  spot price for energy.

2088,"We're in the process of developing a strategy to take us through the next few  months.
But while the (otherwise perishable) thoughts are still fresh in my  mind from the hearings on Monday and Tuesday, I wanted to throw out some  observations for discussion in the days/weeks ahead.
OBSERVATION--The pressure to finger somebody for ""price gouging"" is
",Observations on the Hearings this Week
2089,"Today's hearing was dominated by : 1) many lawyers arguing over whether the Commission must declare that the  ""rate freeze"" is over before raising rates, or whether the Commission can  rely on its general constitutional and statutory authority to raise rates on  an interim basis, without addressing the issue of the rate freeze, and,  1) an appearance by Ralph Nader.
The Legal Issue In general, our proposal seems to have gotten some traction.
Whether it  sticks remains to be seen, however.
We proposed that:  The Commission has the authority to raise rates without addressing the rate  freeze issue.
The Commission will not have the facts it needs, and it won't have  provided  the due process necessary by Jan 4th, to address all the complex issues tied  to the rate freeze.
And if it tries, it's likely to face a flurry of law  suits, which is in no one's best interest.
For it's Jan 4th decision, the Commission should confine itself to  determining whether, and if so by how much, to raise rates to maintain the  utilities' access to capital markets.
(We've taken no position on whether  there's a need to raise rates.)
setting a hearing schedule to examine the ""rate freeze"" and all related  issues thoroughly and methodically.
The utilities argued that the Commission must declare an end to the rate  freeze; otherwise any Commission decision to raise rates would be easy to  attack in the courts.
(In reality, the utilities want the Commission to end  the rate freeze in order to assure lenders that the Commission will permit  the utilities to recover going-forward procurement costs.
Under the rate  freeze, the utility is at risk for procurement costs that exceed the rate  freeze.)
In his presentation, our outside counsel offered numerous citations to past  Commission decision and court cases supporting the Commission's ability to  raise rates if it found it necessary to do so.
Many other parties agreed  with our position.
A few parties said that the issue was too murky to make a  call.
During questioning, both the President of the Commission (Loretta  Lynch) and the presiding judge seemed to indicate that they believe the  Commission has ample authority to raise rates without having to address the  rate freeze issues.
The Ralph Factor Apparently, having lost the Presidential election, Ralph Nader's still  looking for work.
He showed up at the hearings today and held a very lengthy  news conference.
From what I could hear, he targeted all of his criticism at  the utilities for being greedy, and at the Governor for being too ready and  willing to bail the utilities out.
Even when thrown some soft balls about  ""out of state generators,"" Nader stuck to bashing the Governor and the  utilities.
But I couldn't hear the entire press conference, so he may have  said things that I missed.
The Next Steps The hearings that were scheduled to end today will now go into next week.
Tomorrow, the utilities are scheduled to make their case for financial  hardship.
Customers intend to question the utilities very aggressively (as  does the PUC).
The utilities will also have the chance to question the  consumer representatives who filed their own proposals and analysis with the  Commission.
On Tuesday, the Commission is likely to take up the issue of how big any rate  increase needs to be and how much of the increase each customer group should  shoulder.
More tomorrow on the call.

2099,"Late afternoon 1/3/01 news:   USA: Calif utility ratings may fall too far on 7-15 pct hike.
By Jonathan Stempel  01/03/2001  Reuters English News Service  (C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW YORK, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankruptcy may loom and the credit ratings of the  two largest California electric utilities will likely fall too far if that  state's Public Utilities Commission awards them an interim rate hike of 7 to  15 percent, analysts said Wednesday.
In a draft decision on Wednesday, the CPUC proposed an immediate hike of 9  percent for residential customers of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern  California Edison, and hikes of seven to 15 percent for various business  customers.
The CPUC commission is expected to issue a final decision on Thursday.
""It forces the utilities and their creditors to be limbo dancers, and skilled  limbo dancers at that,"" said Shawn Burke, head of U.S. investment-grade  research at Barclays Capital.
PG&E and SCE had requested respective rate increases of 26 percent and 30  percent, a hike that would help them avoid imminent bankruptcy.
The utilities have also asked the regulators to remove a freeze on retail  rates imposed under California's 1996 law that deregulated the state's  electricity market.
On a day when most stocks roared ahead after the Federal Reserve announced  surprise interest rate cuts, investors beat down the stocks of Pacific G&E's  parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , and SoCal Edison's parent, Edison  International .
PG&E shares closed Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange at $17, down  $2-9/16, or 13.1 percent, while Edison International shares closed at  $12-1/4, down $2-3/4, or 18.3 percent, on the Big Board.
Bond quotations were not immediately available for the utilities' bonds,  which in recent weeks have traded like junk.
Pacific G&E and SoCal Edison were banking on a big rate hike to allow them to  pass on some of their soaring wholesale power costs to consumers.
The utilities, which operate under a rate freeze, have accumulated more than  $8 billion in unrecovered costs since wholesale power prices started  skyrocketing last summer amid a worsening electricity shortage in the state.
They claim they are running out of money due to the price freeze, and have  billions of dollars of bills coming due in the next six weeks.
Central to their concerns is whether credit rating agencies Moody's Investors  Service and Standard & Poor's will cut their medium investment grades to junk  status.
""No one knows for sure, but if we consider the average rate hike is only  about 10 percent, it will be difficult for the companies to maintain  investment-grade ratings,"" said Dorothea Matthews, a fixed-income electric  utilities analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex.
Brown.
The utilities have already been unable to tap short-term capital markets  because of their precarious financial state.
Downgrades to junk, which the agencies have already threatened, would cement  the door shut to these markets, and cause the utilities to default on some of  their loans.
Late Wednesday, PG&E Chief Executive Gordon Smith said the commission's  proposed hikes could jeopardize his utility's future loans.
Even a downgrade to the lowest investment grades - ""Baa3"" for long-term debt  and ""Prime-3"" for short-term debt from Moody's, and ""BBB-minus"" and ""A3"" from  S&P - would make the going very difficult for the utilities.
The reason:  short-term debt markets are often closed to companies with those ratings.
""Unless this process allows the rating agencies to keep 'A2/P2' ratings on  the short-term debt of both companies, then this process has largely been a  waste of everyone's time,"" said Burke.
Still, he said, ""there is a reasonable chance, despite today's weak  recommendation, that the situation can be salvaged with mid-'triple-B'  ratings, which would allow a lifeline to conventional sources of liquidity.""
Moody's and S&P were not available for comment.

You've got a tough job.
Guess you'll be working that much  harder now that John Stevens is on his way to San Francisco.
At last week's meeting, a request was made for peak and off peak prices.
I've attached prices that we filed yesterday at FERC as part of its on-going  proceeding of forward contracts.
Few comments:    We'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential,  particularly since the information is covered by FERC's confidentiality  provisions.
Since we are not a ""generator,"" we buy and sell in the market, which as you  know is currently very volatile.
Consequently, the quotes that we provide  customers change daily to reflect changing market prices.
These prices were  put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were  down today.
So quotes we made today were lower.
And quotes we makes  tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be  different from today's.
Because these quotes were assembled yesterday, they are only ""indicative.""

(Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court  agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass  through the power purchase costs to customers.)
The filing is apparently very large.
The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but  said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to  us to make a copy for ourselves.

2160,"Greetings Justin and Laura: As we discussed there is a significant coalition of folks working at the  Legislature to try to remove the prohibition on Direct Access included in  Hertzberg's AB1X and recently signed by the Governor.
Simply put, it is clear that the prohibition will only be removed if the  business community communicates clearly  and unequivocally and vociferously  to the Legislature that Direct Access is a priority for business, and that  the Legislature must amend AB1X to permit Direct Access.

The ARM coalition of energy service providers has been the  focal point of the ever-growing coalition that has developed (and continues  to develop) around the Direct Access issue.

*********************************************************************** UC Pioneers Conservation  Two decades of innovations prepared campuses for energy price crunch  When the state's energy crisis hit, the University of California was not  caught with its fans running full blast.
Across the nine-campus UC system, $65 million has been spent over two decades  on energy-saving devices, including new lighting, variable speed fans, even a  system to harness waste gas from landfills to run boilers.
So, with Gov.
Gray Davis calling for every California household and business  to cut electricity use by 10 percent, UC offers a good model of conservation.
Despite rapid growth in the 178,000-student system in recent years, most  campuses have held electricity consumption steady, and the university will  net about $75 million in savings from the projects.
""We are fortunate to have on the campuses people with the religion.
They have  been working on this agenda since the oil embargo,"" said Gary Matteson, UC  director of energy and utilities planning.

2191,"HEADLINE: Davis faces dire political consequences if power woes linger  BYLINE: By Daniel Borenstein  BODY:  ?
?WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov.
Gray Davis  fails to clean up the power mess.
??
""All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the governor will have on the ticket up and down,"" said state Sen. Don Perata, D-Alameda.
""If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that could be problematic.""
?
?Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters  understand Davis didn't create the problem.
??
""It won't be solved in six months,"" South said.
""This is an immediate  problem that is not susceptible to an immediate solution.
This is a several-year  process to get this situation back under control.""
?
?As for the governor's critics, ""I think they should be asked to produce  their own plan.
It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read  about in the newspapers have no plan.""
?
?The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political damage.
?
?Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a Davis fete.
Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the  state's congressional delegation.
?
?Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally and politically popular across the state.
This would have been the convention for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised  to make the hallmark of his first term.
?
?But electricity now overshadows everything else.
To be sure, the governor will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the convention delegates.
And he is not shying away from the spotlight.
?
?Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California Adventure Theme Park.
That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento who won't be attending to quip, ""We're in fantasy land here, thank you.
We  don't need to go to Disneyland for that.""
?
?Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled  the events of the past week.
""In many ways, he appears to have gone politically  tone deaf,"" said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate University.
""His instincts are not serving him well.""
?
?While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them  that a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis, Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money for his re-election campaign.
?
?When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for  months, Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and that he thought it was premature.
?
?Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue.
""I'm glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight weeks,"" said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch.
""There's a high level of frustration.
There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is.""
?
?South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the governor's control.
""No one can predict with any certainty where this is going to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under control.
We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to do.""
?
?As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and  Democrats remain in a strong position.
After all, he said, the deregulation plan was pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are blocking efforts to cap prices.
?
?Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted Davis could weather the electricity crisis.
""People who are following it know it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't have any plausible alternatives,"" he said.
??
""My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy solution and they're not expecting one.
They may be impatient but they won't necessarily take it out on (Davis).""
?
?It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare, pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.
??
""The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are,"" he said.
""That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this summer.""

2195,"Dan Walters: Politicians seek shelter as energy Armageddon looms    (Published April 4, 2001)  There's been a subtle but unmistakable shift in the political atmosphere that  envelops California's energy crisis.
Politicians have concluded that the crisis is largely beyond their control  and the die is more or less cast.
Whatever fate decrees - massive summer  blackouts, soaring utility bills or even the bankruptcy of the state's  utilities - will happen, and politicians from Gov.
Gray Davis downward are  scrambling to insulate themselves from voters' anger and single out rivals  for blame.
No one is saying that publicly, of course, but the fatalistic mood is very  apparent in the Capitol, whose denizens have dropped their preoccupation with  energy and moved to other matters.
Legislative committees are working on the  hundreds of bills that had been stalled for three months while the special  committees that had been holding almost daily sessions on the energy crisis  have gone into semihibernation.
Last weekend's Democratic state convention in Anaheim was dominated by fears  that when the crisis hits home, the party's dominance of the Capitol will  backfire.
""Just remember Jimmy Carter,"" state Controller Kathleen Connell  warned fellow Democrats, adding that they will have ""no excuses"" for  perceived failure to deal with the crisis forthrightly.
""We will be  accountable on Election Day 2002,"" she said.
Next year's elections are very much on Davis' mind, since he'll be seeking a  second term and polls indicate that his approval ratings have declined  sharply in recent weeks.
He devoted much of the weekend to defending his  actions, saying, ""I believe we've moved at warp speed to address this  problem,"" and trying to pin blame on Republicans.
Republicans, meanwhile, sense that the crisis gives them an avenue of escape  from the dungeon of irrelevancy to which they had been exiled by heavy losses  in the last three elections.
The only remaining statewide GOP officeholder,  Secretary of State Bill Jones, is running for governor by accusing Davis of  mismanagement, and Republican Assembly members dumped their leader, Bill  Campbell, on grounds that he had been insufficiently aggressive vis-a-vis  Davis.
The political positioning reflects the reality that the crisis shows every  sign of worsening.
Although Davis' office is distributing a brochure entitled  ""Meeting the Energy Challenge"" to defend the governor's actions, it's  apparent that none of the steps the governor has taken is bearing much fruit.
The state is spending at least $50 million a day on emergency power  purchases, but what was supposed to be a short-term program has evolved into  a monthslong drain on the state's rapidly shrinking budget reserves.
The  long-term supply contracts that were supposed to replace daily spot purchases  have bogged down, and without firm contracts and a revenue stream to pay for  them, Wall Street is reluctant to market the bonds the state wants to float.
Many authorities now believe Davis' decision to step into the power purchase  market in January was a strategic error because it gave power suppliers a  deep new pocket to tap just as the utilities themselves ran out of credit.
Davis, meanwhile, is refusing to embrace a rate increase approved by the  state Public Utilities Commission, which sends a mixed message to Wall  Street, and efforts to resolve problems with unpaid bills from power  generators and have the state acquire the utilities' intercity transmission  grid have stalled, perhaps permanently.
The crisis may careen totally out of control as summer arrives, raising the  specter of elderly and/or ill Californians dying from having their air  conditioners or medical equipment shut down.
And the utilities are closer to  bankruptcy now than at any other point in the nearly yearlong crisis.
Plan A isn't working, and there is no Plan B - except for bankruptcy.
With  Armageddon looming, politicians have retreated into the bunker, hoping to  protect themselves from what could be a firestorm of anger.

2197,"Energy Firms' Mixed Message Is Focus of Inquiry   Deregulation: Senate panel will investigate whether suppliers were being  misleading when they promised lower rates for consumers while they were also  predicting bigger profits for investors.
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers   In the summer of 1999, a top official with a major player in California's  power market testified during a congressional committee hearing in support of  speeding up deregulation.
Unleashing market forces, said the Dynegy Inc.  executive, would ensure ""maximum customer savings"" and ""low-cost power.""
That same month, the Houston-based firm made a far different pitch to Wall  Street: Deregulation and major swings in electricity prices would boost  revenue and stock value.
""We know how to take advantage of volatility spikes  across the gas and power market,"" Chief Executive Officer Charles Watson  declared in a publication targeting large investors.
""The energy  marketplace,"" he predicted, ""will simply get more volatile.""
Dynegy was not alone, a review of federal filings, company documents and  public records shows.
In the years since California's pioneering deregulation  plan was approved, other major out-of-state energy suppliers were sending  similar, seemingly contradictory signals to the public and stock buyers.

Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the  filing.

The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its  parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and  Exchange Commission.
The utility said in the filing that it ""retains control of its assets and is  authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being  subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court.""
A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail  prices.

2205,"Greetings:  Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what  happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the  following.
Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.
For California  it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC  Commissioner).
Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's  doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who  can explain what the heck California's doing).
Hertzberg then asked that  FERC do ""its part"" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.
Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.
Overall, the ""no price cap"" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be  under considerable pressure to give in to caps).
The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by  9 republicant governors opposing price caps.
Sue will be distributing the  letter.

2208,"Harry:    At the meeting yesterday, we concluded that it would be a good idea to take  the proposal that you put together based on your meeting with EES and use it  as the ""base case"" to start running the numbers.
Idea being that before we  shop anything around, we need to know what the numbers look like to determine  whether the thing's got any legs.
Once we have a clear understanding of how the base case  numbers shake out,  we thought we might then want do some sensitivity analyses around the  variables, come up with a final proposal, and then go back to the commercial  groups for buy-in.
We hoped that your folks could get together with Roger  Yang et al and provide some assessment of what the base case numbers look  like by middle of next week.
How's this plan sound?
Few other points:  We assume that bullet 6's reference to ""net"" means that the deferral is  calculated by taking any ""overcollections"" and subtracting them from any  ""undercollections"" over the entire 3 year period,not year-by-year.
What is the significance of the 3.1 CTC roll-off date?
We're assuming it's  commercially driven.
We correct?
If so, what's the driver?
Same goes for  the 2004 ending date.
Some tweeks were made to the proposal at the meeting to create an ""Option 2""  for folks to consider.
(Though we don't think that any numbers need to be  run on ""Option 2"" until after having completed the analysis on option 1,  since those results could influence any scenarios we decide to construct).
Option 2 would: Keep the hydro with the utility and apply Edison's proposed ratemaking  treatment.
Beginning 6.1.01, make large customers ""noncore,"" similar to the gas model in  California, and force those customers to choose an ESP.
Beginning 1.1.03, introduce competitive default service for remaining ""core""  (i.e., rez and small commercial) customers.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Finally, couple of things that occurred to me after yesterday's meeting that  I want to throw out for folks to react to:  Seems that, to be successful, the proposal needs to remain as stripped down  and simple as possible.
When the proposal nets out the deferral costs, does it include the  over/undercollections associated with utility residual generation?
In option 2, by adding the ""noncore"" feature, and by implementing that  feature and the default service feature prior to the 04 ending date, the  proposal gets more complicated (and adds significantly more risk to the  utility's position).
This is not to say that the complications can't be  worked out, or that the added risk can't be accounted for, but wanted to  highlight it for folks to consider.
Attached is the original, with just a couple of minor edits, and ""Option 2.""

2232,"PR01: 174 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 04/26/2001   GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS  TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA SACRAMENTO  Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase  stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California.
Executive Order D-34-01 Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures  are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X  and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago.
Executive Order D-34-01 will  speed up implementation of the measures.
Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and  distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this  summer.
With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go  through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding.
The  programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included: Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA);  Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters;  Municipal Program; and  Cool Roofs/Building Materials Executive Order D-33-01 Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation  rebate of the ""20/20"" program to the customers in the territory serviced by  the San Diego Gas and Electric Company.
The program is designed to help the  state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who  significantly conserve energy.
In addition, it could save the state up to  $1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state  must buy during expensive summer peak periods.
Executive Order D-32-01 In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from  the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation  of the power plant construction incentive program.
Incentives will include:  $5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and  $2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001;  $4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and  August 1, 2001; and  $3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per  MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and  August 31, 2001.

of CMA) and Keith McCrea  (lawyer for CMA) to follow up on the meeting that Steve and I had with them  regarding the proposal Ken Lay was pushing last week:  They like taking Tx out of the MOU, they like getting DWR out of the power  purchase business, and they think that Edison's MOU needs a little haircut.
McCrea pushed back initially on core/noncore (""why should it be mandatory to  go the market?
""), but after much discussion they agreed that our idea for  core/noncore has a lot of merit.
Our idea is that 1) the core/noncore would take effect in 18-24 months, when  the markets settle and prices come down, 2)  everyone (core and noncore)  should pay for DWR's ""past"" purchases, since everyone consumed it, 3) core  customers should take IOU generation, QFs and DWR contracts (which eliminates  the core's ""net short"" position, and 4) noncore would go to market and would  not have to pay for any of DWR's ""going forward costs"" (since core gets them,  in exchange for getting all the low-cost IOU generation) I told them we are still crunching the numbers to see what the rate effects  would be and would share it with them when we're done.
While they are supportive of this approach and agreed that it would be useful  to continue to flesh it out, they are not convinced that it will get the  necessary support to get passed.
They are also withholding final judgment  until they see all the numbers, i.e., we've still got some work to do.
They are very cynical about anything getting solved in California, and are  extremely upset about the PUC's proposed rate decisions released by the judge  and Loretta Lynch.
They place very little trust in the Governor or the  Legislature.
Interestingly, the rate increase decisions, coupled with calls in Sacramento  for an immediate move to core/noncore, makes our proposal very attractive to  CMA.
Nonetheless, they said that they will continue to engage and are willing to  commit to continue meet to try to get California's mess resolved.

2253,"PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on  Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into  California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the  original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what  generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will  expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03,  or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed  ""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for  the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD  contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and  EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual)  on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might  auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any  specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level  of capacity they choose).
Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.
If you have any  questions, just holler.

2254,"Power shortage shifts attitudes  Posted at 10:51 p.m. PDT Sunday, May 20, 2001  BY NOAM LEVEY  Mercury News Sacramento Bureau  California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy  and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically  shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new  poll shows.
Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the  wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly  two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to  the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California.
And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov.
Gray Davis, whose  approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in  January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll.
``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in  the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey.
``But what is most  surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred.
.
.
.
It is very  dramatic.''
Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting  Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide.
Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important  issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and  6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues.
In  recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top  issue.
And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply,  demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great  deal.''
``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and  without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a  46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose.
Results dismissed  The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as  predictable.
``The voters are in a very bad mood.
They are not happy with  anyone in this drama,'' South said.
``But these poll numbers need to be taken  in context.
.
.
.
People don't understand what he's done because it is very  hard to communicate that in this state.''
South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of  Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year.
Davis is expected  to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including  Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him.
Davis  also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004.
The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current  electricity crisis.
Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are  culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who  blame former Gov.
Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's  landmark deregulation five years ago.
``He didn't make the deregulation disaster.
I think that's Pete Wilson's  legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose.
Criticism for Davis  But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading  California out of its power troubles.
Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling  the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the  governor for not doing more.
Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis  involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to  control the price that California is being forced to pay for power.
The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected.
But for  the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of  words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support  price caps on electricity.
Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and  focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power.
The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of  Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the  crisis.
But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18  percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8  percent favored federal price controls on generators.
That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who  have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of  power to mine the California market for excessive profits.
``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the  price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the  Independent Energy Producers Association.
Electricity generators argue that  price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants.
Backing re-regulation  Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the  electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will  come when Californians' power bills start rising next month.
``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off  the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for  Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
``But in three weeks, California is going to  face a catastrophe.
This is going to hit supernova status.
.
.
.
Once people  understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the  only solution will be re-regulation.''
Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear,  however.
``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people  view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the  Public Policy Institute of California.
``There is less confidence in the  state's ability to plan for the long-term future.
And that is giving people  worry.
``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined  public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''
Mercury News Staff Writer Mike Zapler contributed to this report.
",Power shortage shifts attitudes --Davis Plummets in Polls
2255,"Hertzberg called.
We very briefly discussed the scenarios that he asked us  to build for him.
I've attached the file.
the supporting spreadsheets are  not included.
If folks would like them, let me know.
Please keep the file  confidential.
Hertzberg wanted to see what happened to rates for large (noncore) customers  if the small (core) customers' share of past utility debt is shifted to  noncore customers.
Our analsis shows that noncore rates approach Loretta's recent rate increases  when approximately 50% of core's share of utility past debt is shifted to  businesess (i.e., to noncore).
(In fact, Edison's rate in this scenario is  below the Lynch rate, while PG&E's is modestly above.)
Increasing the cost shift above the 50% level would start to push rates  significantly above the Lynch rates.
Note, however, that in its recent submission to the PUC, DWR's asserts that  it's revenue requirement is substantially higher than the revenues support by  the Lynch rate increase, suggesting that Lynch will have to increase rates  again soon.
In addition, Loretta's rates also do not reflect past utility costs, which  will require yet additional increases.
I expect to have another conversation with the Speaker later this evening or  tomorrow to discuss the scenarios in more detail  (he would still like to put  100% of the IOUs past debts on noncore in exchange for getting a competitive  market and out from under Loretta).
I will report back after we've spoken.

2257,"I spoke again briefly with Hertzberg last night and had a lengthy discussion  late last night with the guy from CSFB who's been providing Hertzberg with  pro bono financial advice on the crisis.
Hertzberg is still hot on putting  all of the utility past due on the noncore, though his consultant and I  agreed that, politically, the number is more likely to end up somewhere south  of 100% (if this thing gets legs).
Hertzberg asked for, and we provided  today, a ""fifth scenario,"" which shows how the numbers work out if 100% of  core's share of utility past due is shifted to noncore.
It's attached.
Will  report back with any further developments.
Note: Please discard the file that I sent you yesterday and replace it with  this one.

Hertzberg is slated to meet with his caucus this evening to discuss the plan.
Conversation with Governor's Financial Advisor Talked to Michael Hoffman today (one of Governor's financial advisors) They've run Hertzberg's version of the core/noncore model (i.e., noncore eats  IOU past due) using their MOU numbers.
They said that the model ""can work"" if noncore can contract for $80/MWH (this  is pretty consistent with our analysis).
Hoffman's guys are doing a final scrub on the numbers and Hoffman will fax me  the results tomorrow AM.
Hertzberg is coming up with ""additional"" twists, however.
The twists include increasing the bond issuance to ~$20B (to keep core rates  down).

2300,"Most folks probably listened in to the press conference, but for those that  didn't here's a summary of the ISO's proposal to FERC.
The description of  the proposal was vague and general, and Winters tends to speak in run-on  sentences, so if I've gotten anything wrong, please chime in.
$100 cap for ""old"" generation; ""new"" generation would be exempt.
FERC would require generators and SCs to contract forward for at least 70% of  their power.
For those that meet the 70% requirement, they will be exempt from the $100  cap, and the $250 cap will apply.
Winters believes that the 70% requirement, coupled with utility-controled  gen, will result in the IOUs scheduling about 85% of load into the forward  market.
Load and supply that deviate from schedules and go to the real time market  will be penalized (details to be ""ironed"" out).

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to  manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a  fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility  in California.
As structured, it will: discourage the development of new generation to serve California fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that  FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap  proposal.

This is the letter  that I spoke of that  was sent to me this morning from one of the ladies at  my church.
She also forwarded this message to several other women outside of  our church.
I want you to read it because I believe that it will encourage  you to trust God if you are not and hold tight if you are because the  effectual fervent prayers of the righteous do avail much.
Like I breifly  stated earlier, I will have my prayer ministry group pray for you tonight and  we will keep on praying for you until I hear you tell me ALL is well.
We try  to meet every Monday night to pray over special prayer request that we have  received along with praying for the needs our families, friends, church,  government and even our enemies.
Our meeting start at 7pm but we really  don't get started praying until 8pm so if you want to touch and agree with us  around that time that would be great.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.
As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.
Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.
Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.
I trust and believe that God will heal.
God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.
So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.
I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.
That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.
I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

2340,"Positive Living Tip of the Day 		Monday January 29, 2001 		 		Your Environment   		 		Do you live or work in an environment that creates undue stress in your life?
If so, realize your environment plays an important role in your life.
Hostile  environments create defensiveness, and an individual's negative behavior can  directly affect others who are trying to maintain a healthy attitude.
For example, if you are working with a supervisor who constantly berates  those under him/her in front of others, this negative behavior affects  everyone in the office.
And hanging around negative friends and family  members can reinforce your own negative traits.
(For example, your temper is  under control as long as you are not around your older brother.)
In addition,  negative people can induce others into developing the same negative attitudes  and behaviors that they possess.
It is true the company you keep is a  reflection on you and can influence your behavior.
Steer clear of negative  environments and begin building a positive life.

2355,"Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 12, No.
6, November 26, 2001  (Editor's Note - I'm sending this in four pieces today because it is a bigger issue than usual due to the spring recruiting in basketball, track and softball.)
Volume 12, No.
6, November 26, 2001   Benson, Defense Stifle Ags; Huge Upsets Propel Horns Into Big 12 Title Game Against Colorado  As Longhorn defensive coordinator Carl Reese noted, it was an old-fashioned, rock-em, sock-em game in College Station before a state record football crowd of 87,555 Friday, and Texas won it with a gritty defense and two late touchdowns by outstanding freshman RB Cedric Benson.
After taking the 21-7 victory, head coach Mack Brown congratulated the team on its fine 10-1 season and said he wasn't worried about the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) ""because we'll be in it.""
I don't know if had a crystal ball, but immediately after the Longhorns' expected victory, top-rated Nebraska was humiliated, 62-36, by Colorado, and the next day No.
3 Oklahoma, a 27-point favorite lost at home to Oklahoma State, 16-13.
It was only the fifth time OSU has won at OU.
The good news is those games moved Texas up to the No.
3 spot in both major polls and put the Longhorns back in control of their own destiny for the first time since that 14-3 loss to OU back in October.
Texas plays Colorado Saturday at 7 p.m. in Irving's Texas Stadium for the Big 12 Championship and an automatic berth in one of the four BCS bowls, possibly even the Rose Bowl in the national title game.
But the bad news is that a loss to the stampeding Buffaloes would knock the Longhorns out of the BCS mix.
Brown and his players are tickled orange, however, at the chance to play for the conference championship.
""The BCS isn't an issue today,"" Brown said Saturday after the huge upset in Norman.
""The Bowl game isn't an issue today.""
""We said we needed to get to the championship game,"" he said, ""but once you get there, you need to win.
After that, you just look up and try to figure out where you are.""
""People have been asking us about the BCS for five weeks,"" Brown said.
""Obviously we said we needed to wait until the end (of the season) and the end's not even near where it should be.""
""People haven't given us or Colorado a chance to be in this game for five weeks.
To our kids' credit and to Colorado's kids credit, they kept working hard and now they are in this game.""
The coaches and players have to forget the Aggie game and get ready for the Buffaloes, but we can enjoy it just a little longer.
This was a game where the defenses weren't going to give up a lot, but the Longhorns got an early special teams touchdown when CB Roderick Babers blocked a punt and WR Tony Jeffery scooped it up and scored.
The Aggies tied it on a 27-yard drive after a fine punt return in the third quarter when they had the benefit of the strong wind, which was around 15 miles per hour with frequent gusts to 25 or 30 miles per hour.
But Nathan Vasher made a couple of good punt returns and Texas started the pivotal fourth quarter with the wind and a drive into Aggie territory that changed the field position for the rest of the game.
After a short Aggie punt midway through the period, the Longhorns rode Benson's strong legs to a touchdown, then they got another from the powerful freshman after Everick Rawls' interception in the final two minutes.
Here, briefly, is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred.
After each defense got a quick stop, the Aggies were stymied a second time and Babers blocked the punt and Jeffery returned it 23 yards for a Longhorn TD and a 7-0 lead with 7:44 left.
Another three-and-out by the Aggies, followed by a shanked punt, gave Texas possession at the UT 47.
The Horns made one first down and Dusty Mangum missed a 49-yard field goal try.
Defenses dominated the quarter.
A&M led in first downs, 3-2, and in total yardage, 40-25.
Second Quarter A shanked punt by UT's Brian Bradford set the Aggies up at the Longhorn 47.
A&M couldn't move, but punted the ball dead at the UT 7.
The Longhorn offense, which had done little with the stiff wind, couldn't move into it, and Bradford's 30-yard punt, a good one into the wind, gave A&M possessiion at the UT 39.
The Aggies made a first  down at the 26 before stalling.
Cody Scates missed a 43-yard field goal attempt.
An interception of a long pass at the UT 5 by safety Ahmad Brooks with just under five minutes left in the half finally pumped a little life into the Longhorn offense, which drove to midfield and killed all but 50 seconds of the half before stalling.
Texas had a 7-5 lead in first downs and a 92-60 lead in total offense at intermission.
Third Quarter Texas got the ball going into the wind to start the second half.
The Horns couldn't move and punted.
A&M's Mickey Jones almost tied the game on the punt return, starting right, then racing left and going down the sideline for 37 yards before being pushed out of bounds at the UT 27.
The Aggies hit a pass to the UT 8, then 220-pound RB Keith Joseph took over, powering to the left to the 4, then taking a pitchout to the right for the TD to tie the game with 10:41 left.
The Horns came right back with a good drive to midfield, sparked by two passes from Simms to TE Bo Scaife.
But, facing fourth down with an inch or two needed, a lineman flinched and UT drew a 5-yard penalty and had to punt.
Fourth Quarter Benson, who had been stymied throughout the first three quarters, got 5 and then 24 yards on his first two carries of the final period, getting the Horns to the Aggie 45.
But the UT offense stalled again and Bradford's punt was killed at the Aggie 8.
The Texas defense force a quick punt into the wind and Vasher alertly ran up and caught the short punt at the A&M 40 and returned it to the 35.
Benson got loose for 12 to the 23, then got 5 and 2 to the 16.
On third and 3, Simms hit Scaife coming across the middle  to the A&M 5.
Benson powered through the right side for the TD on the next play.
Mangum's kick put UT on top, 14-7, with 7:22 left.
Rawls interception at the A&M 27 and return to the 12 with 1:59 left set up the final UT touchdown.
Benson got 1, then ran through a big hole and powered through two defenders for the TD and the final 21-7 count.
Rose Bowl Road Full of Thorns   If you still have some hope the Longhorns will be playing for the national title in the Rose Bowl on January 3, here's what it would take: 1.
A victory over Colorado Saturday.
2.
A loss for either Florida or Miami and probably a loss for Oregon, too, because the Ducks were ahead of Texas in the last BCS ratings.
The Horns have to be No.
1 or No.
2 in the final BCS ratings on December 9 to get to Pasadena.
Miami plays at Virginia Tech Saturday, while Florida hosts Tennessee and Oregon also is at home against Oregon State If Florida beats Tennessee, the Gators would have to win the SEC title game on December 8 against the winner of Saturday's game between Auburn and LSU.
Since that game is in Baton Rouge and Auburn's outstanding running back broke his shoulder two weeks ago, LSU probably will be the Gators' Dec. 8 opponent.
It's asking a lot for two of those three teams to lose a game, but after the games in Boulder and Norman last weekend, anything is possible.
Longhorn Notes  * Saturday's meeting between Texas and Colorado will be the sixth Big 12 Championship Game.
Texas won the inaugural title game in 1996, Nebraska triumphed in 1997 and 1999, Texas A&M won the title in 1998 and Oklahoma took the crown in 2000.
If Texas wins Saturday, the Longhorns will join Nebraska as the only two-time champs.
* Since the Big 12 Championship Game counts in statistical manners, RB Cedric Benson has a great chance to become the first Longhorn freshman to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season.
He has 974 yards and ranks second among Longhorn freshmen behind Ricky Williams, who rushed for 990 yards in 1995.
* Benson broke the UT freshman record for touchdowns with his pair of fourth-quarter rushing scores.
He has 12 touchdowns on the season  - 11 rushing and one on a shovel pass reception  -breaking the record of 10 set by

""We actually had an Aggie block.
We'd worked on it all week, but it wasn't working, so we went back to our regular block ande I just had to beat the guy in front of me.
When I saw it was a linebacker, I knew he was in trouble.
Linebackers aren't quick enough to block me.
If I can't get by a big old guy like that, I don't deserve my scholarship.""

They were in man-for-man, and all we had to do was beat the guy in front of us.
That's my first touchdown as a special teams player.""
- Texas wide receiver Tony Jeffery, who scooped up the ball Babers blocked and ran it in for the game's first touchdown * * * * ""We did a good job against the run.
I thought Maurice Gordon probably played as good as he's every played for us.
Their center (All-Big 12 Seth McKinney) is a good ball player and at times he couldn't block him.
I thought all our guys played pretty well today.
This was a good old-fashioned football game, with both teams playing good defense, and a break or two deciding the outcome.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese * * * * ""We felt like if we would just hang in there and hang in there, we'd eventually get the running game going, and Cedric (Benson) and the offensive line did a great job in the fourth quarter.
With Cedric, you don't have to abandon the running game because you know he'll break loose sooner or later.
We didn't want to take too many chances and give them a short field because we knew they would have a hard time making a long drive with our defense playing so well.""

2357,"Part 3  Recruiting Roundup  Today (Monday) was the day the Longhorn coaches could start another big recruiting push by going to top recruits' schools and homes, but the big game Saturday has pushed that back a week.
But don't worry about it.
Coach Mack Brown wrote the book on recruiting and his previous four classes at Texas have been very good, and some of them have been great.
This year's class has a chance to be as good as any Brown and his assistants have signed.
There's a chance it could be the best of the bunch, even better than the top-rated Chris Simms, Cory Redding class.
They already have 16 commitments, about half of them from players who have been on at least one national top 100 list, and their class already is ranked as one of the top five in the nation.
Let's take a look at where they are and where they are going: OFFENSE Quarterback UT has a commitment from Billy Don Malone of Paris North Lamar, who is a lot better than most of the gurus think, and the Horns have close to a 50-50 shot at Vincent Young, the wonder kid at Houston Madison, who had his usual game Friday for the undefeated Marlins, doing everything on offense and even running an interception back for a touchdown.
(Yes, he plays defense, too, when needed.)
Running Back The Horns have a commitment from Clint Haney of unbeaten Smithson Valley and are in the hunt for power-runner deluxe Albert Hardy of Galena Park and elusive Selvin Young of Jersey Village.
They have an outside shot at Lorenzo Booker of Ventura, Cal., the nation's highest rated running back.
Tight End David Thomas of Wolfforth Frenship, a national top 100 player on some lists, is already committed.
He is very good.
The only other TE the Horns are recruiting is Eric Winston, the humongous pass catcher and blocker deluxe at Midland Lee.
Wide Receiver National top 100 star Marquis Johnson of Champaign, Ill., and Dustin Miksch of Round Rock Westwood are already committed.
Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus, a supremely talented player who has little playing experience because of transfer problems, is a possibility, and, if the Horns don't get him, they might wind up with Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls or Anthony Wright of Klein Forest.
Line The Horns already have a pledge from Neale Tweedie of Allen, a great pass blocker who is on several national top 100 lists, and from Brett Valdez of Brownwood, a tremendous run blocker.
They are still recruiting Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield.
Blalock is the best run blocker I've seen this year.
DEFENSE End Chase Pittman of Shreveport Evangel, a national top 100 player, has committed and will enroll in January and go through spring training, which will give him a chance to see action as a true freshman.
The Longhorns are in the hunt for Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., a speed rusher deluxe, Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands.
All three are on every national top 100 list I've seen.
Tackle Texas has commitments from four top tackles - Sonny Davis of Gulf Coast Community College, a JC in Mississippi, Earl Anderson of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein of Scottsdale Chapaparral and Tully Jantzen of Keller.
Davis has some academic issues.
Sendlein also is a very good offensive lineman and Jantzen is swift enough to play end.
Texas has a very good shot at Rodrique Wr ight of Alief Hastings, the nation's top DT, and at Marco Martin of Mesquite, another national top 100 player.
Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo, who excels at DT and OG, also is a strong possibility.
It's 50-50 on whether he will play offense or defense in college.
He is the son of David Studdard, a former UT offensive line star who had a long career with the Denver Broncos.
Linebacker Texas starts three seniors and needs a great group.
Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar, Brian Robison of of Splendora and Marcus Myers of Pflugerville are already committed and the Horns are still recruiting several top one from Texas and across the country.
A. J. Nicholson of Winston Salem, N. C., and Aaron Thomas of North Mesquite are national top 100 middle backers who are strongly considering Texas, and Michael Williams of Lindale and Rufus Alexander of Baton Rouge Christian Life, are fast outside backers the Horns are recruiting.
Another possibility is Lance Mitchell a top JC linebacker in California who ir orignally from Dallas.
He is considering taking a visit.
Defensive Backs Matt Melton, a hard-hitting safety from Tyler, is already committed.
Swift Edorian McCullough of North Garland, the Class 5A 100 meter champ, also is considering Texas, along with Brodney Pool, a big, fast safety from Houston Westbury.
Kicker Texas is looking for a kicker, but has not homed in on one yet.
The coaches want someone who can kick off into the end zone consistently.
Longhorn Basketball Adds Pair  Twotop basketball recruits have signed with Texas, head coach Rick Barnes has announced.
Brad Buckman, a 6-9, 235-pound forward from Austin Westlake, and Kenton Paulino, 6-2, 165, a com bo guard from  Los Angeles Fremond HS who will play for Maine Central Institute this season, are the new signees.
""Signing Brad and Kenton is another sign that our program is really on the rise,"" Barnes said.
""Both have great athleticism and an attitude of winning about them that we need to continue to bring to The University of Texas.""
Buckman plays for coach Clifton McNeely is at Westlake and is a national top 30 recruit.
The No.
2 high school prospect in  Texas according to Mike Kunstadt's Texas Hoops, Buckman averaged 19.8 points, 10.4 rebounds and 4.3 blocks per game during his junior season.
He also is tabbed the No.
15 prospect in the nation by Clark Francis' Hoop Scoop.
Buckman earned Most Outstanding Player honors at the prestigious Pitt3 Five-Star Camp this July in Pittsburgh, Pa. ""There's not a program in the nation that did not go after Brad during the recruiting period, so to come out on top in that battle is a huge win for us,"" Barnes said.
""Brad turned down four of the most storied programs in college basketball history for the opportunity to play at Texas.""
Barnes said.
""He made one of the biggest jumps in his game that I have seen during the summer camp period.
Brad has a tremendous competitive fire and is one of those players that fans here will really appreciate.""
Paulino plays under coach Carl Hendrickson at Maine Central.
He starred at Fremont High School under coach Sam Sullivan, where he averaged 24 points a game and earned Los Angeles Co-Player of the Year accolades during his senior campaign.
""Kenton is one of those explosive scoring guards that we need in our program,"" Barnes said.
""He is a very good shooter with range and an exceptional athlete who high-jumped 6-10 in high school.
Kenton is the complete guard we were looking for.""
Horns Sign 2 in Softball  Texas softball coach Connie Clark has signed centerfielder Tina Boutelle of Katy Taylor and second baseman Chezare Sievers of Aliso Niguel HS in Mission Viejo, Calif. ""We are excited about signing two of the top recruits in the country,"" Clark said.
""Tina and Chezare will be immediate impact players for us.
We only lose two players to graduation in the spring of 2002 and are pleased to have Tina and Chezare as our newest additions to the softball program.""
Boutelle, a 5-5 left-handed hitter, was named first team All-American as a junior while helping her team to a 31-4 record and a second-place finish at the Texas 5A State Championship.
She also is an All-District and All-Greater Houston selection.
She was named to the Texas Girls Coaches Association All-State Team and first team Academic All-District in 2000.
Boutelle helped the Katy Cruisers club team to its second consecutive ASA Gold National Championship in 2001, playing with UT freshmen pitcher Cat Os terman and third baseman/shortstop Tiffany Anders.
With her addition, the Longhorns will have five players on the roster that have played for the Katy Cruisers.
""Tina is definitely a long-ball threat,"" Clark said.
""She has tremendously quick hands and extremely good foot speed.
Tina also is the type of player to make things happen because she plays with a lot of passion and enthusiasm.""
Sievers  finished her 2001 season with a .427 batting average and 19 RBIs.
She was named first team All-League and second team All-County as a junior.
The 5-0 infielder also was named first team All-California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) as a sophomore.
She is a member of the California Cruisers club team, which placed second at the 2001 ASA Gold National Championships to the Katy Cruisers.
""Chez can cover a lot of ground,"" Clark said.
""She is an extra-base type of hitter who also has the ability to play the short game.
Chez also has tremendously quick hands and I think fans will be excited to watch her play.""
Longhorn Women Start Fast  Sophomore center-forward Stacy Stephens led the Longhorn women's basketball team to the championship of the Paradise Jam Tournament in St. Thomas last weekend.
Stephens was named the tourney MVP after leading Texas past Southern California, 66-64, in the championship game.

2358,"Part 4  Kearney Recruits Terrific Class Five of the nation's top prep track and field prospects, including four state champions and one national high school record-holder, have signed with Longhorn women's track coach Beverly Kearney.
The class is headed by four of the nation's top sprinters - Ychlindria Spears of Luling, who also is the national record holder in the triple jump; Ashlee Williams of Dallas Bishop Dunne, who also had the nation's top high hurdles clocking last season; state Class 4A 100, 200 and triple jump champ LaToya Phelps of Greenville; Florida sprint-jump star Sanya Richards of Fort Lauderdale St. Thomas Aquinas, and relay ace Sheretta Jones of Houston Forest Brook.
""We are really excited about the class we have coming in for the 2003 season,"" Kearney said.
""The quality of this class is phenomenal and this may be one of the best we've put together since we've been here.""
""Each athlete in this class is an exceptional signee, but together they take it to a whole other level.
They are competitive, mature and focused, and we are extremely excited about the quality of individuals we are bringing into the program.""
Kearney's class is headlined by Spears, who was the 2001 Gatorade National High School Girls' Track and Field Athlete of the Year as a junior.
The nation's top prep female jumper and a proven sprinter, Spears set a national high school record in the triple jump with a 44-2 1/4 mark at the 2001 Texas 3A State Championships last May.
Besides winning the triple at last spring's state meet, Spears claimed gold in the long jump and swept the 100- and 200-meter dashes on her way to scoring all 40 of Luling's third-place points.
Her season-best long jump of 20-9 1/4 also led the nation last year, and she went on to win the USATF Junior Nationals in the event with a wind-aided 20-9 3/4 effort.
She ended her junior season as the state's top performer in all classifications in the long and triple jumps, No.
2 in the 200 (23.84) and No.
5 in the 100 (11.64).
Prior to her junior year, Spears qualified for the 2000 U.S. Olympic Trials in the long jump where she finished 14th in her flight.
Over the last three years, Spears has won 11 out of a possible 12 gold medals at the state meet and won over 40 events on the district, regional, state and national levels.
Spears is also an honor student, ranking in the top five percent of her class.
""Ychlindria is a phenomenal athlete who can add quality depth in the long jump, triple jump and 100 immediately,"" Kearney said.
""She has all the tools necessary to be successful not only on the collegiate level, but internationally as well.
She is talented and versatile and we think she is one of the most competitive athletes out there.""
Williams is one of the top prep sprinter-hurdler prospects in the country.
A standout for Dallas Bishop Dunne High on the TAPPS 4A level, she has swept state titles in the 200, 100 hurdles and 4x100 and 4x200 relay the last two seasons in leading Bishop Dunne to consecutive team titles Last March, Williams set a state record in the 100 hurdles with a personal-best 13.23 clocking at the Texas Southern Invitational in Houston.
Last summer, she struck gold in the 100 hurdles at the USATF Junior Nationals in Richmond, Va., and at the Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, Calif. She closed her junior season as the nation's top prep performer in the 100 hurdles and No.
15 in the 100 (11.67).
Williams also posted the state's third fastest time in the 200 (23.81) and the No.
7 time in the 100.
""Ashlee is one of the fastest hurdlers to come out in several years,"" Kearney said.
""She has the potential to develop into a great hurdler and sprinter.
She reminds me a lot of (former Longhorn track and field star) Angie Vaughn, but she is much faster and more seasoned at this point.""
Richards has been one of the top all-around track and field performers in the Florida high school ranks for the past three years, making her mark in the sprints and jumps.
She has led St. Thomas Aquinas to three consecutive Florida 3A State Championships, the most recent coming last spring when she grabbed gold in the 100, long jump and 4x100 relay and silver in the 400.
At the 2000 state meet, Richards swept the 100, 200, long jump and 4x100 relay to lead her team to a convincing 110-point win.
On the national level last summer, Richards swept the 100 and 200 at the USATF Junior Olympics and placed fourth in the 400 at the Adidas Outdoor Championships in Raleigh, N.C. Indoors, she was second in the 200 and third in the 60 at the New York Armory NSIC last March.
She finished her season ranked No.
6 nationally  in the 200 (23.57) and long jump (19-11 1/2), No.
7 in the 400 (53.47) and No.
8 in the 100 (11.59).
""Sanya is the youngest member of this class, but she is a soldier,"" Kearney said.
""She is a team all wrapped up by herself, because she can do so many different things.""
Phelps , who also a standout basketball player, won the 100 in 11.55, the 200 in 23.8 and the triple jump  with a 42-8 1/4 leapat the 2001 Texas 4A State Meet.
She won district titles in the 100, 200, 4x200 relay, long jump and triple jump and regional titles in the 100, 200 and triple jump.
Her personal-best triple jump of 42-8 1/4 ranked No.
2 nationally at the end of her junior season.
""LaToya may be the sleeper of this class,"" Kearney said.
""She is a phenomenal athlete and an excellent basketball player.
She won three state titles last year as a junior, and she is one of the top triple jumpers in the country.""
Jones has been one of the state's top quarter-milers as a member of perennial power Houston Forest Brook's track and field teams the past two years.
She won district and regional titles in the 400, with a best time of 55.5, on her way to finishing fourth in the quarter at the Texas 4A State Championships last May.
She also helped the school's 4x400 relay squad to the district title and runner-up finishes at the regional and state meets.
As a sophomore, she finished third in the 400 and 4x400 relay at the state meet.
""Sheretta has done an outstanding job for Forest Brook on the relays and in the sprints,"" Kearney said.
""I look at her open performances and I think she'll be able to contribute right away.
She reminds me of (current Longhorn) Raasin McIntosh, and we think she can end up being as good as anyone.""
UT Men Sign Great Track Class Five top high school recruits, headed by Austin Reagan High sprinter Brendan Christian, plus one All-American transfer from Arkansas, have signed with Longhorn men's trackcoach Bubba Thornton.
The NCAA track and field signing period started last Wednesday and extends through this Wednesday.
In addition to Christian, the Longhorn track signees include twin brothers Aaron and Ashton Collins of New Orleans Clark, Nicholas Johnson of Fort Worth Wyatt, Joe Thorne of Atlanta Lakeview)and the Arkansas transfer - Jason Ward of Tilgham HS in Paducah, Ky. Christian is one of the nation's top sprinters in the 100 and 200, where he holds the state Class 4A record with a 20.56 clocking at the State Meet last May, and he also has run a 45.5 leg on Reagan's 1,600-meter relay team.
Johnson, the younger brother of Longhorn senior sprinter Amar Johnson, is another top sprinter with a 10.33 100 meters clocking.
The Collins brothers are outstanding in the longer sprints, Thorne is one of nation's top performers in the distance races and the steeplechase, and Ward is already established as one of the top triple jumpers at the collegiate level.
""In our minds, this is one of the top classes in the nation,"" Thornton said.
""Each athlete has an immediate chance to contribute to our program next year.
They can have a national impact for us right away, not just in their performances but as leaders as well.""
""Each individual has great qualities, and we're excited about this class as a whole,"" he said.
""They all are aware of the national scene and are looking forward to competing against NCAA-caliber athletes.""
Christian, one of the top three or four sprinters in the country, is the defending Texas Class 4A state champion and record holder in the 200-meter dash, as well as anchoring  Reagan's regional champion 4x100 and 4x400 relay teams.
Christian also won 100-meter title last summer at the Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships in Raleigh, N.C., and Golden West Invitational in Sacramento, Calif.
He set the national high school indoor record in the 200 (21.02) at the New York Armory NSIC in March.
He  also won the 60 at that meet and swept the 55 and 200 at the Arkansas National High School Invitational in January.
Christian enters his senior season ranked No.
2 nationally in the 200 (20.56) and No.
4 in the 100 (10.40).
Johnson is a Texas 4A district and regional 100-meter champion for perennial track power Fort Worth Wyatt.
In addition to finishing fourth at last year's state track meet in the 100, Johnson also ran legs on the Chaparrals' district champion and state runner-up 4x100-meter relay squad which ended the season with the second-fastest time in the country (40.39).
He ranks in the national top 10 in the 100 (10.33w) as he enters the 2002  season.
The Collins twins have been stars on the Louisiana track and field scene for the last three years for New Orleans Clark High.
Ashton was a five-time 4A state champion last year, winning titles in the 400 (indoor and outdoor), 800, 4x200 and 4x400 relay.
He also placed fourth in the quarter at the Golden West Invitational last summer, and is the No.
2-ranked returning quarter-miler in the nation (46.29).
Aaron won three state crowns last year in the 200, 4x200 and 4x400 relay.
Thorne won the Georgia 5A individual cross country title in leading his Lakeside High team to a fourth-place finish at the state meet on Nov. 3.
He also posted the second-fastest 5k time in the country this season with a time of 14:41 at the Alexander Invitational on Oct. 6.
Thorne is the defending state champion in the 1,600 and 3,200, posting the state's top times in both events last season.
Against some of the top runners in the country, he finished fourth in his first-ever 2,000-meter steeplechase at the 2001 Adidas Outdoor Track & Field Championships.
He also placed 12th at the 2000 Foot Locker National Cross Country Championship in Raleigh, and is one of the favorites to challenge for the South Regional and National crowns this year.
Ward, the sophomore transfer from Arkansas, was an All-American and All-SEC performer in the triple jump as a freshman.
He skipped to a personal-best mark of 54-6 to become the national runner-up at the 2000 NCAA Indoor Championships in Fayetteville, Ark.
He also finished fourth at the SEC Championships with a 52-2 3/4 effort.
At Paducah Tilgham High, Ward was a five-time All-American in track and field.
He also won the triple jump at the USATF Junior Nationals in 1999.

The news of the Europe office closing so suddenly has certainly been = unsettling.
Absent any tangible news pertaining to the fate of our office = I thought that I could, at a minimum, try to explain to people what I've se= en going on over the last couple of days.
On the trading side we are doing several things.
First, we are trying to h= onor as many of our physical delivery obligations as possible.
Several cus= tomers have stopped making deliveries to us which is making it impossible f= or us, in turn, to honor all of our physical deliveries.
In these circumst= ances we are constantly updating our customers on the status of their sched= ules so that they can make alternative arraingements.
The Cash Trading, Sc= heduling, Services, and Real Time groups are doing an unbelievable job with=  this.
I am impressed at how capable, professional, and calm our team has = remained.
On the Term Trading side we are working with our customers to cl= ose out positions.
This process is going very smoothly as well.
We traded=  a record volume yesterday as our customers reduced their exposure to us.
= The Term trading team has done an excellent job with this.
Third, on the M= iddle Market and Origination side we are trying to work with customers to b= ring cash in the door.
Many customers owe us money due to out of the money=  future positions.
Many customers would prefer to settle up with us now ra= ther than in bankruptcy if that is what ends up happening to us.
We have b= rought a significant amount of cash in the door as a result of these effort= s and saved our customers from going through a potentially onerous bankrupt= cy proceeding.
I am very appreciative of the efforts of our Origination an= d Middle Marketing team that has made this happen.
On the bright side, I remain optimistic that someone will buy or fund the N= orth America gas and power businesses.
While it is impossible to handicap = anything these days with Enron I am seeing some very positive signs on this=  front.
Unlike the Dynegy deal, which required Dynegy to purchase the very=  profitable core business along along with the rest of Enron's baggage, the=  deals being considered now would likely involve only the core business.
I=  don't know whether these deals happen, and if they do, I don't know what f= orm the core business takes as a result.
Chris Calger and I have been part=  of the team talking to our potential suitors.
We will both be in Houston = through the weekend and into early next week working on this.
We will upda= te people as soon as possible as things unfold.
I know that this situation really sucks.
Given the anxiety and uncertainty=  that we are all feeling people are doing a great job keeping focused and s= taying positive.
I think that things are going to unfold very quickly from=  here -- most likely in the next week or two.
Please hang in there.

2362,"This morning Enron's credit rating was downgraded to junk status which is below investment grade.
This is very bad news for Enron's future prospects.
The flurry of activity that you see from the trading and scheduling team is a direct result of our credit downgrade.
Many of our contracts have provisions that allow our customers to stop performing on their contracts with us if Enron's credit rating falls below investment grade and if we are unable to post sufficient collateral.
The trading, scheduling, and legal team are working together to figure out how to meet our physical delivery obligations over the next several weeks.
This is our number one priority right now.
I will still be holding the floor meeting at 1 PM today.
I would like to hold the meeting earlier but am not sure that I will be able to do so.

Many government and commercial facilities in the United States have already received Anthrax threat letters containing powdery substances.
Most of these have, however, been determined to be false alarms.
We have no reason to believe that Enron has been or will be the target of an Anthrax attack, but we want to provide all employees with background information on Anthrax and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.
If you have additional questions or concerns, please contact Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.
The most important thing to remember is:  Do not panic.
To infect someone, the Anthrax organism must be rubbed into abraded skin, swallowed, or inhaled as a fine, aerosolized mist.
Infection can be prevented after exposure to Anthrax by early treatment with the appropriate antibiotics.
Anthrax cannot be spread from one person to another.
Following are guidelines for identifying and dealing with suspicious letters or packages:  What constitutes a suspicious letter or parcel?

2448,"Jerry Scarbrough's True Orange The Newsletter for the True Texas Longhorn Faithful  Volume 12, No.
3, October 29, 2001   Simms Throws 4 TD Passes, Benson Rushes For 157 Yards as Longhorns Gore Tigers, 35-16  Junior QB Chris Simms and true freshman RB Cedric Benson had career-best days and the UT defense held Missouri to just one first down in the first and third quarters Saturday in Columbia to lead Texas to a 35-16 victory.
On a day when upsets reigned across the country, particularly in the top 10, and five of the eight previously unbeaten teams lost, the Longhorns took care of business and ran their record to 7-1 overall and 4-1 in the Big 12.
With Oklahoma's 20-10 loss at Nebraska, the Sooners, Longhorns and Aggies are all tied atop the standings in the Big 12 South.
But the Longhorns have to win out and Oklahoma has to lose another conference game for the Longhorns to make it to the Big 12 Championship Game.
Saturday's victory at Missouri was a fairly easy conquest, thanks to the stout UT defense and a great performance by the offensive line that allowed Simms to complete 24 of 30 passes (80%) for 229 yards and four touchdowns and Benson to run for 157 yards on 31 carries, an average of 5.1 yards a pop.
But some strange things happened to thwart the Longhorns in the early going.
On their first drive, for example, they held the ball almost 10 minutes, rolling 78 yards in 19 plays, but they got zero points because they stalled at the Tiger 2 and Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.
They also drove into Missouri territory on their second possession, but again stalled.
Missouri finally got rolling to start the second quarter and scored first.
That seemed to wake up the Longhorn offense and it took control and wore out the Missouri defenders.
Here, briefly, is how the game went First Quarter Texas won the toss and deferred.
Missouri took the ball and Marcus James ran the UT kick back to the 38.
The Longhorn defense forced a quick three-and-out and the UT offense had its most time-consuming drive of the year, going 78 yards in a laborious 10-minute, 19-play drive to the Tiger 2, but Dusty Mangum missed the chip-shot field goal.
Missouri went three-and-out again.
The Horns drove to midfield again, but stalled as the quarter ended.
Texas had a huge lead in statistics, with 7 first downs to 0 for Missouri, a 99-24 edge in total offense, and a 12:03 to 2:57 bulge in time of possession, but the game was all even at 0-0 in the only statistic that counts.
Second Quarter The Tigers finally got their offense untracked to start the second quarter and drove 76 yards, primarily on the passing of QB Kirk Farmer, to take a 7-0 lead with 11:12 left.
Victor Ike ran the kickoff back to the 36 and the Longhorns went 64 yards in 10 plays to tie it up.
Simms connected with WR B. J. Johnson on the 5-yard TD toss, but the big play was a 27-yarder from Simms to TE Bo Scaife on third-and-2 at the Missouri 32.
Mangum's kick tied it, 7-7, with 5:44 left.
After the UT defense forced another quick 3-and-out and got a short punt, Simms found Scaife again on the first play for a 28-yard gain to the MU 13.
A WR reverse by Johnson got 5 yards and Benson got 5 more and a first down at the 3 before Simms faked to Benson and hit TE Brock Edwards for the final 3 yards and the TD.
Mangum's kick gave Texas a 14-7 lead with 1:50 left.
The Tigers stormed down the field in the final two minutes, primarily on the running of 5-10, 225-pound Zack Abron, who gained 37 yards in three carries.
His 16-yard tackle-breaking run to the 5 gave the Tigers a first-and-goal, but his next try gained only a yard and Farmer threw two incompletions before Brad Hammerich booted a 22-yard field goal to cut the UT lead to 14-10 with 7 seconds left.
The Tigers outgained the Longhorns in the quarter, 120 to 104 yards and had a 9-5 edge in first downs.
Third Quarter Texas got the ball and again made a long, time-consuming drive, but this time it counted because Simms scored from the 1 to cap a 73-yard drive and Mangum converted for  a 21-10 lead with 8:50 left.
the Longhorns overcame a third-and-11 early in the drive when Simms scrambled and found Brett Robin for 24 yards.
Vasher intercepted Farmer four plays later to give the Horns great field position at the MU 48.
The Longhorns couldn't move, but the pick kept Missouri bottled up deep in its own territory throughout the quarter and allowed Texas to start its possessions around midfield in a quarter that was dominated by defense after Texas' impressive opening drive.
The Tigers made only one first down in the quarter and Texas, after getting five first downs on that opening TD drive, managed only one more in the entire quarter.
Fourth Quarter The Tigers finally figured out their best offense  was to hand the ball to Abron and he bulled for 16, 19, 3 and then 7 more for a TD.
Missouri's pass for a 2-point conversion failed and left UT on top, 28-16, with 7:41 left.
Not to be outdone, Benson shredded the Missouri defense for 11, 20 and then 4 before Simms scrambled left and found  Robin, who scampered the final 25 yards to complete a 39-yard scoring play.
Mangum's kick gave Texas a 35-16 lead with 4:27 left.
Texas and the BCS  The next Bowl Championship Series (BCS) standings will be a lot different from the first ones that were announced last week and Texas will be a lot higher than it was in the last one.
In the first standings, which were announced last Monday, Texas was ranked No.
6 behind five teams with perfect records.
The BCS standings are like golf in that the lowest score is the best score.
Oklahoma came in at No.
1 in the first standings at 3.06, followed by Nebraska at 6.40, UCLA at 8.34, Miami at 12.01, Virginia Tech at 13.88, Texas at 15.35 and Michigan at 15.91, to round out the top seven.
But a rash of upsets claimed OU, UCLA and Virginia Tech.
Since OU lost to Nebraska, the Sooners won't tumble far, but Texas should pass UCLA and VT. Of course, Michigan is so close to Texas that the Wolverines might pass the Horns if they keep winning.
Under the BCS formula, the top four teams in the final standings are guaranteed berths in one of the four BCS Bowls, which are the Rose, Orange, Fiesta and Sugar.
The Rose Bowl will get the national title game this year.
Right now, that looks like a Nebraska-Miami battle, but both teams have some big games left before making that date.
Texas could make it to the Rose Bowl, but it would require some big upsets, like Texas A&M or Texas Tech upsetting Oklahoma, and then Texas beating Nebraska in the Big 12 title game.
But the Longhorns will make it to one of the big BCS bowls if they keep winning.
Key Games for BCS Watchers  If you want to keep tabs on the Longhorns' chances to wind up in good shape in one of the big four BCS bowls, the key is that they have to win their final three regular season games.
Assuming that happens, here are some key games to watch for the rest of the season: This Saturday's key games are Michigan at Michigan State, Tennessee at Notre Dame and UCLA at Washington State.
The big ones the following Saturday, Nov. 10, are Texas A&M at Oklahoma and UCLA at Oregon.
On Nov. 17, Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma, Syracuse is at Miami, Michigan is at Wisconsin and Virginia Tech is at Virginia.
On Thanksgiving weekend, Michigan hosts Ohio State, Nebraska goes to Colorado
","True Orange, October 29, 2001, Part 1 of 3"
2449,"Part 2  Recruiting Roundup  The status of three outstanding players Texas is recruiting is rather murky at this time.
LB Garnet Smith of Arlington Lamar is committed to Texas, but is setting up visits to Oklahoma (he was once committed to the Sooners) and several other schools.
WR Robert Timmons of Flower Mound Marcus committed to Florida and LB Michael Williams of Lindale committed to Oklahoma last week, but then they both decommitted.
Williams attended Texas A&M's game Saturday and plans to come to take an official visit to Texas the December 14 weekend.
* * * * The Longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or more national top 100 teams.
They are WR Marquis Johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of Centennial High School in Champaign, Illinois;  DE Chase Pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of Shreveport Evangel; LB Garnet Smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of Arlington Lamar, DTs Sonny Davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of Gulf Coast JC in Mississippi and formerly of Austin Lanier, Earl Anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of San Marcos, Lyle Sendlein, 6-4,  260, 4.8, of Scottsdale Chaparral, the two-time defending Class 4A champion in Arizona; OLs  Brett Valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of  Brownwood and Neale Tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of Allen;  and TE David Thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of Wolfforth Frenship.
Davis made all of the top national lists last year.
However, he injured a knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a lot of academic ground to cover to graduate.
The other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller; LBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round Rock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North Lamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.
* * * * The Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent Young of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of Houston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony Wright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of Plano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks, Okla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs Rodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey Studdard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and Lindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool of Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.
If the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four top players on my 25-man ""difference-maker"" list.
They already have No.
4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.
1 Wright, No.
2 Young and No.
3 Dibbles.
If Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the leader right now.
He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.
The Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at kicking off into the end zone.
Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the best I've seen this year at booting them deep.
College kickers start five yards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.
* * * * INTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back.
Consider this item in last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50 national  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled ""8 Players to watch: ""Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something special.""

""We were able to spread the field today because (tight end) Bo Scaife made some great catches and that opened things up.
I think Bo gives us the ability to stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the defense has to be aware of where he is at all times.
(Quarterback) Chris (Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half.""
- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis * * * * ""This was a great team win for us.
The offense did a great job of hanging on the ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting some three-and-outs.
That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it up.
I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai Pearson for shutting down their big-play receivers.
Jammer held (WR) Justin Gage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we decided to give him the primary coverage on him.""
- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese * * * * ""I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter.
I think our offensive line just wore them down a little.
Coach Brown and coach Davis told me I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep running and pounding as hard as I could.
It feels good to be part of the record book.""
- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he is the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at Texas * * * * ""I was getting real clean releases.
I used my speed to my advantage.
I was getting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and our wide receivers.
They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to them.""
- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones for 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns * * * * ""We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA (Stanford won).
That's what I call a good day.""
- UT quarterback Chris Simms * * * * ""When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy.
Then I heard the Virginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game came as quite a surprise.
That's three teams in the top five of the BCS.""

2471,"Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.
Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are  appropriate to hit the net ENA target.
In order to stay flat year on year, I  split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.
As we had  discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units  and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the  accountability managed by each of you.
All outside variable costs,  specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units  eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs,  outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for  specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.
I look at this  cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business  and evaluate/manage our risks.

2475,"Rob, independent of dotted/solid lines, you already have the primary and  complete responsibility to manage the office and the business.
At the risk  of being bold,  I think the undercurrent of your note and your discussions  with Haedicke over the last couple of days is a matter of absolute control.
Ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial  people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.
With the back  and mid office,  the current Enron model is based upon scale and  standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage.
Further, it  helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue.
In the  long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together,  less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc.
A lot of your points are very valid and Haedicke has never and never will get  in the way of managing commercial business; however, Mark, Wes, Sally, Beth  et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized  delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire.
Don't  quit protecting the business and your people; however, please help accomplish  some of these goals as well.

Lets take the earliest opporunity to discuss this.

2476,"Wow, if Haug spent more time making money than created bull.... in the  company we would be a $100 stock.
On a different note, I was wondering if someone in your shop could map the  current A&A process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager  promotion  for the typical associate including timeline.
This process  mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.
I think radical change is not the answer.
The answer lies in a combination  of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key  points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible  key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where  necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the  program internally.
Overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet  commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.
The goals of any restructuring are:  a) eliminate the perception that the program is not receptive to the  business units needs or any bu's perception that they lack ownership for the  program;  b) increase the quality of the recruits that are brought in and retained;  c) ensure we have the best people in the organization recruiting, selling  and interviewing;  d) ensure that we have the best commercial training program that firmly  grounds the associate in the ""Enron technology"" which include skills in  market understanding, structuring, finance, logistics and risk;  e) ensure the business units have the ability to identify the outstanding  talent early and give those people the responsibility necessary to move them  up the curve quickly (ie) quickly identify the Whalley/Lavorato's in the  program and, on the flip side, quickly deal with clear non-performance issues;  f) review the effectiveness of the current PRC process as a development,  retention and performance tool;  g) incorporate mid-year flexibility, internet recruiting techniques,  non-traditional sources of talent and  h) increase cost effectiveness.
The solutions may include mandated participation by certain business units,  people and teams, business tracks, etc.
I think a thorough process mapping/tracking can identify (or help me see) the  key spots for change/modification/ownership that reach these goals with the  least amount of wholesale change for the sake of change.
I think we need to get back to Jeff not next week but the following week with  a strawman.

In a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by Mass.
General Hospital in Boston,  part of the Healthcare Partners system, is desiring a steam and electric  contract.
The steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 MW  of power.
I think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all  their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that HP  controls in the nation.
The consultants name is Joe Petrowski (203)451-9747.
I spoke to him  yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.

2491,"Ken, I have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the ARC Northern  Gas Pipeline Route.
Ultimately, I believe that ARC is looking for certain  strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of  this proposal.
To the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory  pipe, ENA's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis  markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward  characteristics.
Other than understanding the potential flows and costs,  there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ENA  point of view.
The ARC consortium needs to fund approximately $30M to develop this project.
The US and Canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10M.
the remaining $20M and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines,  venture capital and the ""organizing group"" (40%!!).
Stan Horton, if he  believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million  of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to  participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality.

Assuming that the sales process is largely completed, I see some  value for Enron to take this deal including:  a) $200 M in TCV for 2000;  b) $3 to $5 M in value;  c) GE on our EES resume of companies which will help in future sales to the  large industrial customers;  and d) provides an ""in"" to the GE family of companies which could result in  significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product.

Further, I want to  confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie  putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the  short run value of the project.
In other works, we have no intention of  lifting their offer.
Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.

2510,"Guys, I have explained the strategy/tactics that have lead to this position  in some detail.
In my opinion the company is not at risk and potentially ENA  could create significant value from a project that we have very little  invested.
I understand the construction risk on the bid as much as anyone  and we have no intention of lifting their offer.
As far as EECC involvement,  as I had mentioned, Coleman was a part of all these discussions.
I will  argue that Mike and the ENA deal team made the right call necessary to  maximize return in the short run for Enron without investing significant  dollars or taking significant risks.
Obviously, I was unsuccessful in explaining such a sophisticated strategy.

In an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups  we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued  monthly and to be reviewed at the QBR.
I am a strong believer in that what  is measured and rewarded gets done.
As well, the middle market capability is  crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics  which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and  that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market  groups.

2524,"Jeff, you will be receiving a DASH from the principal investing group which  does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, I do think this  is a venture we should support.
In a nutshell, it is providing $10MM, in  seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation  company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing  2MW to 22MW mobile turbine-generator sets.
These units are fully mobile via  the nations highways and can meet single digit NOX requirements given current  SCR technology.
They are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency  power, VAR creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable.
The ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets  that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and  constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.
The benefits include:  a) 50% plus interest in a new distributed generation company with the  opportunity to raise private funds at later rounds and ultimately the  possibility of an IPO - similar companies in this space include Active Power,  Capstone and Elektryon;  b) origination opportunities - the ENA mid-stream origination groups believe  that there are numerous opportunities (2001 to 2002 time frame) to utilize  this technology to take advantage of market opportunities and customer  applications;  c) learning - the distributed generation/renewable space is an area of  critical importance for ENA and EES to understand.
If ENA through this  venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in  our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk;  d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital  would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology  did not work or the market did not materialize;  e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/SCR technology;  and f) ENA would have a controlling position in this new venture.
However, this venture is different than Active Power and several other  Principal Investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company  and b) ENA will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the  technology proves out.
Given, that we could benefit most from the successful  application of this venture, it is worth the initial work.
Our partner is Power Systems Manufacturing of Boca Raton, Florida.
We have a  very solid history with this company.
They have successfully solved many of  the technical issues surrounding the Korean 6B's which are currently  operating at New Albany.
They would bring the technical and engineering  expertise at cost for their 50%.
ENA would ultimately have a buy-out clause  at a fixed number for their 50% .
If you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and I  will set up a meeting.

In addition, ENA is  paying a higher price, sharing credits and have voluntarily increased the  term to twelve years from ten.
I do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than  a complete re-trade on the original transaction.
I hope this is not the  case.

I am asking for the three teams to  clearly identify the outsourcing targets, lead sales and structuring people  and the timing as far as starting discussion with each target customer  (ASAP).
I would hope that the Mexican and Canadian teams would lead the  sales process and the Houston team lead the structuring, customer facing and  execution but I will let you decide the optimum mix.
Either way, I am  expecting this target list completed and agreed to in the next two weeks for  Canada and Mexico;  and d) for Tembec I don't think it makes sense to change the deal team at  this point; however, the US team will keep the Canadian team in the loop and  if the products become non-outsourcing related the deal should be passed to  ECC.

2567,"George, it is probably worth  speaking to them about the US assets - probably  the smaller Virginia sites which are probably less core and may be great  brownfield sites.
I'm not sure we would have an interest in UK coal fired  assets.
I would speak to Sherriff on that one.
However, I would caution that  real value is created through RAPID brownfield development leveraging on  Enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents.
For ComEd and Homer City, Mission has already paid up for these assets based  on gas being on the margin.
Now that was before a lot of the run up so it  may be worthwhile; however, I think it may be difficult to arb these guys.
As well, I think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - I'm not  sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a  Wall Street point of view.
We should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core Virginia  assets.
Are they in QF, if so there may be upside in the deal from Duran's  point of view..  Dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger  part of the load curve, coal assets or coal QF's may be great assets for us  from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view.
Have we looked at this?

2590,"Tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11.0M) has been amortized  for the last several years and expensed to the Industrial groups (McConville  and Ondarza).
As you are aware, I sued them for breach.
The settlement  involved the elimination of all existing transactions between Ft. James and  Enron including the Wauna and Halsey power contracts.
It is my understanding  that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the Portland  shop.
The elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the  lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement I originated.
It seemed logical  to charge the Portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.8M as  a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent  liability.

2641,"Ken and Jeff:  Glen Darden, the President and CEO of Quicksilver Resources, Inc., is a longtime personal and professional friend of mine.
Recently, he has asked whether I would consider serving as an outside Director on the Board of Directors of Quicksilver.
Before meeting with Glen to discuss this further, I want to make sure that Enron does not have any objections.
Headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas, Quicksilver is a natural gas and crude oil production company engaged in the development and acquisition of long-lived producing natural gas and oil properties.
Quicksilver began trading publicly in March of 1999 on the American Stock Exchange (KWK).
Quicksilver has a long standing business relationship with Enron.
Enron has historically entered into pre-pays and hedging transactions related to natural gas production and continues to do so today.
Enron (via JEDI) also provided some financing at the time of the merger of Quicksilver and Mercury Exploration and was a significant shareholder of Quicksilver at the time of its initial public offering.
I believe JEDI has since divested this stockholding.
If I were to serve on the board of Quicksilver, I expect that there will be related party transactions of a routine ongoing nature that would need to be disclosed and which I would need to abstain from voting on as a member of the board.
However, I do not feel there would be any material conflicts of interest as Quicksilver's core business is complementary to Enron, not competitive with Enron.
As a personal matter, it is an experience that would be beneficial and would provide valuable personal visibility in our industry.
I am scheduled to meet with Glen and others at Quicksilver later this month to further discuss this possibility.
Would each of you please let me know after due consideration whether you have any objection to or concern with the position.
Please do not hesitate to call me (x67713) if you have any questions or wish to discuss this further.

Yesterday, the Missouri state court judge denied our motion to dismiss for failure to make a demand first on the Sprint board of directors.
The Sprint board has now established a special litigation committee, which will investigate the allegations and make a report and recommendation to the court.
As you may know, special litigation committees rely heavily on independent counsel for conducting the investigation and writing reports.
The selection of independent counsel is made by the special litigation committee.
However, because the committee is unaware of counsel who do this type of work, I am writing to solicit any recommendations you may have.
If your board of directors has used a special litigation committee, and you believe that independent counsel had the requisite experience to get the job done in a timely, complete and professional manner, I would appreciate a reply to this message.

The private sector must continue to play a central role in this effort.

2661,"Jim,   as I mentioned to you earlier we are forging ahead with the Enron Corp. interests project in Europe.
We commenced our work based on discussions with Jim Fallon, Ray Bowen and others about a week ago and plan to pay the employees with funds currently held by EEFT.
I expect to receive tomorrow a formalized structure for the teams, again organized around EEFT.
As I understand it, however, this proposal will not address any retention bonuses for the teams because this issue is still under discussion.
I have been told that there is hesitancy on the part of some in Houston to provide for such payments but I do not know the reason for that hesitancy.
May I suggest that it would be entirely appropriate to provide for retention payments in this case.
As I have mentioned, part of this project is to recover value from existing contracts in entities such as ECTRIC, which value is estimated in the aggregate to be $150 to 200 million.
Another aspect of the Corp. interest project is to properly wind up entities so as to recover value and minimize director liabilities.
A proposal was made that a percentage of the recovered value would be put into a bonus pool and shared among all of the team members, whether those individuals had focused on recovery of funds or minimizing liabilities.
I am told that this proposal was rejected in a conference call held today.
I am very concerned about our ability to keep people working on this project without some additional incentive.
The project is extremely difficult and many people, in particular the traders who are in a position to protect value in ECTRIC, have other job options.
In addition, the employees on the team are aware that many individuals who are working on PWC teams are receiving retention payments.
If the team to protect the ECTRIC interests is not retained in the short term, ECTRIC is scheduled to be put into administration on January 4, resulting in termination of many of its in-the-money contracts and a loss of an estimated 50% of its value.
Jim, if you are inclined to support retention payments to help us maintain this effort going forward, will you please communicate that fact to Jim Fallon, Jeff McMahon and Ray Bowen tomorrow, as it is likely we will begin to lose people after Christmas.

2678,"Hello Jim, I just want to keep you up on the situation with  our office spaces in Jones Hall.
The Civic Center will be going to City Council  this week to ask for monies to rebuild the SPA and Symphony offices, and the  rehearsal hall, music library, instrument storage, etc.
If approved, I'm  told the City will allow us to have the offices rebuilt by the contractor of our  choice.
We will want the contractor who originally built our offices 6 or  7 years ago.
However, the rebuild will take between 10 and 12 weeks.
That  means we will not return to offices until, say, end of February, assuming some  work will be accomplished in December.
We told Enron that we should return to Jones Hall  by the end of this year; obviously that won't happen.
Of course, we would want  to remain in our present offices on the 37th floor of Three Allen Center until  the end of February.
But, is this possible?

2684,"Bob and I just spoke with Steve Susman.
I tried to mention the points you asked.
Here are his comments:  	1.
F&J probably could not simply send us our files back and put itself in a position to be adverse to us with Arthur Anderson.
Susman believes that there is a ""hot potato"" rule that prevents F&J from doing so.
2.
That being said, Susman doesn't care if F&J represents Arthur Anderson or anyone else potentially adverse to us in the actions he is handling.
3.
Susman would not, however, agree to a broad advance ethical waiver, as proposed by F&J.
He does not believe such waivers are effective.
Susman would agree to a waiver once we were advised who F&J wanted to represent.
I don't know whether F&J would agree to this or not.
4.
Susman recognizes that we cannot force F&J to take on the new Mariner matter, and that this is ultimately a risk/benefit decision for us to make, and that we may have to agree to terms that we otherwise wouldn't agree to.
Parenthetically, I have received no comments on F&J's proposed waiver letter.
Under the circumstances, from his standpoint, Bob is inclined for us to get the best deal on the waiver letter that we can with F&J, but that if F&J won't budge, that we take something along the lines of what they have given us (Bob, let me know if I have mischaracterized your thoughts).
From my standpoint, I unfortunately think there are some parts of the letter that we must have changed.
This would be to the extent that the letter purports to have Enron Corp. agree to bind all the Enron entities, and to the extent that it involves Enron's agreement to what will happen after the Dynegy merger (as I set out in my earlier e-mail).
My recommendation would be, as set forth in my earlier e-mail, that only the Enron entities currently being represented by F&J sign it and be bound by it, and to remove the language regarding what Enron would agree to after the Dynegy merger.
I also find the advance ethical waiver language repugnant, but could agree to it if the other modifications mentioned could be made.
I do not know whether F&J would be willing to make these changes or not.
Our biggest problem right now is time-management.
I know that Mariner wanted to make a decision by today as to who to use.
I am willing to confer with Dutton ASAP to see what F&J would agree to, and if he can agree in principle, to send him a proposed draft agreement.
I believe he is out of the office but is checking his voice-mail.
Please let me know what you want me to do.

2686,"Gentlemen -  Following the Dabhol dictate that ""bad news is good news,"" Dabhol is getting some good news this week.
As reported in the press, DPC did receive a two-page letter from MSEB purporting to rescind the PPA with immediate effect because DPC materially misrepresented the capabilities of the power plant (i.e., 6 hour actual ramp-up time vs. 3 hour ramp-up schedule in the PPA).
However, the letter goes on to state that MSEB is ""agreeable to continue the present arrangement of power and payment until disputes are resolved by the appropriate forum.""
We are not entirely sure what this last part means and are asking MSEB for clarification.
Obviously, this letter is quite a buttress to our already-delivered PTN contending that MSEB has evidenced an intention not to be bound by the PPA.
While MSEB's letter seems to state that they will still honor some aspects of the PPA, the letter adds that ""payments would be subject to adjustments on the basis of determination of reasonable compensation and quantum meruit by a competent authority.""
We hear rumors that MSEB will approach the Maharasthra Energy Regulatory Commission (MERC) for a ""how much should we pay DPC"" determination.
If they do so and MERC accepts jurisdiction, this would help our expropriation, political force majeure and default arguments.
DPC seems to have managed to avoid a construction contractor termination in May by agreeing to extend the required completion date for Block B by 9 days.
While this action does not have long-term benefits to the project, I believe that it was a considerable sign of good faith that DPC is trying to give the lenders some time to assess whether they want to begin curing project agreement defaults on an ongoing basis.

We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months.
They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus.

2689,"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.
The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.
Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.
Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000.
The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities.
The current contract lasts for five months.
Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.
Enron in the Middle East  Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
[Maclean, Iona]    Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder.
The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.
Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German border was reached last week.
Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub.
Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was  to set up a working group similiar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub.
More than 40 companies participated in the meeting, representing producers, end users, Dutch and German transportation companies, marketing, and trading companies.
More than 12 companies, including Ruhrgas and Gaz de France, were interested in joining the working group, but in the end the decision was taken to restrict the number of companies making up the working group to eight so as to ensure effecient and effective decision-making.
The following companies were elected to become members of the working group: Centrica, Gasunie, Wingas, BEB, Statoil, Distrigaz, Duke Energy and Enron.
Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

2703,"The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in  his underwear.
Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist  at me!
The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I  have not.
In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date),  I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review  to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think,  in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.
The Law Review had  reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.
I arrived late at  night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,   took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the  room key, and opened the door.
The darkness that shrouded the room was  suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a  bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very  large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had  violated the sanctity of his room!
It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was   adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough  for me to offer him one.
Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman  when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as  my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale  of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.
There may well have  been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the  end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately.
After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent  reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made  my way to the meeting room.
During the course of the day, I spotted the  madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.
Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew  him.
The answer was no, but he did know who he was.
""The name is Susman, my  man, Steve Susman"".
I immediately resolved that my path and that of   ""Susman, my man, Steve Susman"" would never again cross.
Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.
How could I have possibly foreseen  as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago  that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as  his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as  one of my closest friends!
I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only  for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on  me that night.
Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any  other way.
I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.
Thanks for your friendship--I

2724,"Ed and Mark,   As we discussed, I spoke to Jeff Hodge and Travis McCullough about the best  way to document this deal.
We all agreed that it is better to document the  deal as a deferred payment on the sale of natural gas rather than as a loan.
Documenting the deal as a loan does not add any protection for Enron and in  fact, may be detrimental because of the various laws concerning loans and  lenders.
The protections  and remedies afforded by the Master track those  that Enron would have under a loan document.
Enron would be in no better  position to collect from NUI in the event of bankruptcy under a loan document  than under the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.
Additionally, I assume  that NUI, being a regulated utility, will not want to or be able to document  this deal as a loan.

2732,"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : October 29, 2001 ALJ Clears Transwestern of Market Power Charges  A FERC administrative law judge has found no improprieties, nor evidence of the exercise of market power in negotiated rate contracts between Transwestern Pipeline and two shippers on its system, which resulted in the shippers being charged as much as $27/MMBtu last February, far in excess of the pipeline's allowed transportation rate of 38 cents/MMBtu (RP97-288-009).
ALJ Jacob Leventhal had only one fault to find, and that was with Transwestern's method of posting capacity.
The judge said, and Transwestern agreed, to modify its tariff ""so that all posting, bidding and award procedures are set forth in a separate provision with an appropriate caption"" on its Internet bulletin board.
Shippers had said that reviewing capacity on the Transwestern web site was ""a tortuous process.""
Indicated Shippers claimed Transwestern's inadequate capacity posting and award procedures did not provide all interested parties with an opportunity to bid for the capacity that was available.
While ""both Indicated Shippers and (FERC) Staff find it curious that SET (Sempra Energy Trading) and Richardson (Products Co.) were the sole bidders on the contracts awarded to each of them...curiosity does not translate into proof,"" the judge said.
Witnesses in the expedited hearing testified no bids were considered in advance of the capacity posting.
The judge subsequently found the capacity was awarded in a manner consistent with Transwestern's tariff.
Similarly, Levanthal could find no evidence that Transwestern exercised market power in negotiating the rates with shippers or withholding or threatening to withhold capacity.
The capacity was available at recourse rates, and the shippers knew those rates were available.
""Staff's arguments really are criticisms of the posting and award procedures, but do not demonstrate the exercise of market power.""
The two shippers said they made a business decision to propose the ""index-to-index"" formula that produced the higher rates, rather than take the recourse rate ""to minimize any risk on transportation options.""
The index-to-index formula refers to taking the difference between the daily published commodity prices at two different points and subtracting to get the transportation rate between them.
In this case the two points were the San Juan Basin and the SoCal Needles delivery point.
The case was set for expedited hearing last summer by the commissioners acting on staff recommendations.
",NGI Article on TW Ruling
2733,"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  published : November 13, 2001 Watson: Enron Upside 'Clearly Worth Doing the Deal'  Dynegy CEO Chuck Watson told the investment community Monday that he was ""90% sure"" that the risk/reward ratio in the planned merger with Enron Corp. made it ""clearly worth doing the deal,"" because the issues that decimated the former market leader were with its non-core businesses.
Explaining that his team had ""adequately bracketed the downside,"" as the deal fell together over the past few weeks, Watson said he could not be ""99% positive,"" but noted that the upside was ""substantial,"" and said he had a ""good deal of confidence...that we'll be absolutely fine here.""
Dynegy, which announced a $22 billion cash, stock and debt deal with its downtown Houston rival on Friday night, joined with Enron executives including Chairman Kenneth Lay on Monday to answer as many questions as they could in about 90 minutes.
If all goes to plan, the two companies would become Dynegy Inc. by the third quarter of 2002, the clear leader in natural gas and power marketing.
In the second quarter 2001, Enron and Dynegy combined sold a total of 36.2 Bcf/d of gas, which represented 21% of the volumes sold by the top 20 gas marketers in North America (168.9 Bcf/d), according to a ranking by NGI.
Enron was the top gas marketer with 25.3 Bcf/d and Dynegy was No.
6 with 10.9 Bcf/d.
Statistics provided by Maryland-based Energy Performance Review (EPR) show that Enron and Dynegy combined sold 143,824 million kWh of power in the second quarter.
That total represented 14% of the power sold by the top 20 largest power marketers (1,000,961 million kWh), according to EPR.
Enron was in fifth place among power marketers with 73,724 million kWh sold, while Dynegy was in sixth place with 70,100 million kWh.
The blending of the two will not come without challenges, but Watson stressed he expects to see more opportunities than problems.
The opportunity appears to have come none too soon for Enron.
Greg Whalley, Enron's president and a future member of Dynegy's executive team, confirmed that without some kind of equity investment in the company, the once market leader probably could not have sustained its liquidity through the rest of this year.
""We definitely needed to raise some type of equity capital,"" said Whalley.
""Under normal market conditions, we would have had adequate liquidity.
This was not normal for Enron.
We would not have had liquidity to the end of the year.""
Asked about asset sales in anticipation of meeting federal requirements to merge, executives acknowledged there would be some, but did not elaborate.
Whalley said that from an ""Enron perspective, we have not spent a lot of time with Dynegy people to agree on a plan.
Chuck (Watson) has to clear what is core to Dynegy.
There are several (assets for consideration to sell) on the list.""
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay, who will not be part of the management team, but may hold a place on the Dynegy board of directors, added that Enron already has $4 billion in sales under contract, all expected to close by the end of 2002.
""We also have three other significant international assets under contract,"" said Lay, referring to the among other things, the Dabhol power plant in India.
Once the merger of Dynegy with Enron is successfully completed, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary market player in all markets,"" but there will be a significant difference in how the company moves forward, noted Dynegy CFO Rob Doty.
Enron's financial-backed trading strategy will merge with the ""strong asset base"" of Dynegy's.
Dynegy has protected itself on the downside, however.
The deal includes an out for Dynegy if Enron's legal liabilities exceed $3.5 billion.
Asked about the possibility that some of Enron's marketing and trading team may desert the company for another company, Watson, stressing that teamwork will be the guiding force going forward, said, ""if I were in this industry, this is the combination I'd work for.
This is an exciting day here.
It's been an exciting couple of weeks"" creating a ""platform for something really special in the future.""
Enron's Whalley said that he believes the company will keep most of its team intact.
""They're accustomed to being part of a winning deal,"" he said, and ""going forward, they will be very pleased with the additional infusion of equity and the stability in the marketplace.""
As of Monday morning, Whalley said that ""activity looks pretty good,"" and said there had been a positive reception to the merger.
""Right now, people are pleased with the introduction of new liquidity, and really want to go about establishing or re-establishing the energy franchise.""
Dynegy President Steve Bergstrom agreed.
""Most traders want to be part of a winning team.
This is a combination that will be a winning team.
We have similar issues there as well.
The 'A' players will stay around to be part of the winning team.""
Bergstrom explained that when the merger is complete, the new Dynegy will become the ""primary player in all markets.""
He said Dynegy has a ""more asset-backed strategy,"" adding that he has said before that ""you can only have one market maker and Enron clearly was it.""
By combining the two companies, there will be a blend of Dynegy's asset strategy with Enron's ""financial skill set,"" giving the new entity ""more liquidity market-making than Dynegy itself has historically done.""
Added Watson, ""both companies had a successful ratio and nothing is going to change there...I'm a strong believer in teams and the team concept.
I don't want to see individuals do well if the company doesn't do well.
It (will be) imbedded in the whole company.""
Ben Schlesinger, whose company Schlesinger & Associates analyzes the energy industry, said Monday that the big problem in the merger is ""whether these two companies are able to pull together...to harness what's there.""
He said the ""two parties are clearly leaders,"" but theoretically, they will have to streamline their operations.
""Both books are fairly strong,"" he said, and once their efficiencies are put together, the new company will offer ""stable returns.""
In the ""very short term,"" however, Schlesinger said there will be moves to other traders.
Other analysts also seemed to be throwing support behind the merger.
UBS Warburg reiterated its ""strong buy"" rating on Dynegy, noting that ""if successfully executed, this transaction would yield the most widely recognized, respected and downright credible wholesale/retail energy merchant in the world.""
However, UBS warned that Dynegy still faces a ""daunting"" task in merging the operations and employees.
""We are not naive in underestimating the enormous challenge at hand.
In the near-term, Enron must remain highly liquid, investment grade and its employees must remain focused on keeping its core wholesale/retail franchises up and running.""
Merrill Lynch's Donato Eassey reiterated the ""buy"" on Dynegy and ""moving to no opinion"" on Enron.
He said, ""Dynegy has all the necessary skill sets and as importantly, the financial stability, resources and investor confidence and experience to get the job done...Enron's unparalleled online trading business should translate to significant prospects for the new Dynegy.""
Curt Launer, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston, added that despite the size of the new company, ""we do not expect major divestitures or closing issues because of the lack of asset concentration and the inherent competitiveness of the natural gas and power marketing business.""
He noted too that with the combination, ""we have modeled a merchant unit that does 25% less business,"" because of ""cross trading between them and some expectation of a loss of market share.""
Still, Launer said Dynegy would become a ""formidable competitor"" benefiting from a market share in excess of 20% of U.S. natural gas and power trading markets.""
As expected with most major merger announcements, Moody's Investors Service placed the ratings of Dynegy and its subsidiaries under review for possible downgrade, noting that ""notwithstanding the franchise benefits of the proposed merger, the financial and business risks associated with the transaction could negatively impact Dynegy's credit fundamentals.""
The review affects about $4 billion of Dynegy securities, including its subsidiaries Illinova Corp. and Illinois Power Co.
In its rating review, Moody's said it will ""assess Dynegy's plans to meet the liquidity needs of the combined entity and to deal with the uncertainty surrounding Enron's off-balance sheet transactions and contingent risks...and examine the ultimate structure of the transaction, and its impact on Dynegy's financial leverage and on management's targeted debt levels.""
The ratings service also plans to ""consider the governance framework within which the combined trading activities will operate.""
Ratings under review are: Dynegy's Prime-3 rating for commercial paper; Dynegy Holdings' Baa2 senior unsecured debt rating and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper; Illinova Corp.'s Baa3 senior unsecured debt rating; and Illinois Power Co.'s Baa1 senior secured and Baa2 senior unsecured debt ratings, and its Prime-2 rating for commercial paper.
Fitch revised its rating watch on Enron's outstanding securities to ""evolving"" from ""negative,"" where they were placed in late October.
The rating watch evolving means the ratings may be raised, lowered or maintained.
Fitch also placed a rating watch negative on Dynegy and Dynegy Holding's long-term credit ratings, which also means they could be lowered or affirmed.
The outstanding ""F2"" rated commercial paper programs for Dynegy and Dynegy Holdings were not affected.

2771,"Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park 8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001  sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON  Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being.
AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.
Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.
These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .
(Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)
Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.
Tickets are not required for the lawn area.
About Coppelia Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes.
The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century.
Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: ""Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score.
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.""
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer.
In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company.
When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, ""It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.""
(The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop.
The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity.
Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat.
In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

2777,"BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS  Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.
The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.
The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.
These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.
It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.
In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.
Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant.
Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.
The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS.
Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system.
Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas.
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics.
Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt.
Belvieu storage facilities.
In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt.
Belvieu.
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.

2807,"Tom and Tammy,  	After talking with Dan Masters yesterday, I believe we have the Buy / Sale incorrect in our system.
In Sitarra, the deal (Sale side #672336) was set up for a monthly total of 10,920 (should acutally be 10,902) and was set up for March 16 - 31.
Being that the dates were set as such, a total was calculated for those days only producing a volume of 5,632 to sell back to Enron LNG.
Dan Masters says that the buyback contract was not supposed to be daily and should be for the full monthly amount of 10,902 mmbtu.
He says that they sold us the full contract amount and that they bought back the full 10,902.
Could both of you please look at this and correct the volumes in our system so that I can invoice Enron LNG for the 10,902 mmbtu instead of the 5,632?

2826,"February 4, 2002 Enron boss cancels testimony  Cites 'disturbing' TV talk: Blames 'prosecutorial' tone, claims of security fraud Jason Chow  National Post  Former Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay said yesterday he would not testify at today's scheduled congressional hearing into the company's collapse, blaming legislators' ""prosecutorial"" comments on TV talk shows yesterday.
""Not only were there corrupt practices, we are finding what may clearly end up being security fraud,"" Republican Rep. Billy Tauzin, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, told NBC's Meet the Press.
An internal company report released Saturday criticized Mr. Lay, other executives, board members and auditors for the collapse.
It showed managers took home millions of dollars through complex partnerships, while hiding at least US$1-billion in losses.
Other politicians denounced the company's management before TV cameras yesterday in response to the report.
Last night, Mr. Lay cancelled his testimony.
""In the midst of our preparation, particularly disturbing statements have been made by members of Congress, even today, on the eve of Mr. Lay's scheduled appearance,"" his lawyer, Earl Silbert, said in a letter to lawmakers on the Senate Commerce Committee and the House Financial Services Committee.
""I have instructed Mr. Lay to withdraw his prior acceptance of your invitation.""
Sen. Byron Dorgan, chairman of another Senate Commerce subcommittee investigating the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, said on Meet the Press the report ""suggests massive problems"" and shows ""a culture of corruption.""
While Mr. Dorgan said it was up to the U.S. Justice Department to decide whether to press criminal charges, he added the report showed ""clearly some things have happened here that are going to put some people here in real jeopardy.""
The 203-page report, written by a team headed by the dean of the University of Texas Law School, said Mr. Lay ""bears significant responsibility"" for ""flawed decisions"" in approving some transactions that hid debt and offset losses.
The report said these transactions did not follow accounting rules and were implemented improperly, resulting in Enron overstating earnings by US$1-billion during a one-year period starting in September, 2000.
""Ken Lay obviously had to know that this was a giant pyramid scheme -- a giant shell game,"" said Republican Sen. Peter Fitzgerald.

2828,"Some points of interest for the week,=20 Equity Market Update=20 There is a tug-o-war in the market between the crisis in confidence caused = by the Enron debacle and the increasingly positive nature of the economic d= ata.
First, let's chat about the Enron fall-out.
The market seems to be suffering from a nasty case of Enron-itis, as some o= f the talking heads have called the recent negative sentiment in the market= .
Clearly something changed with the bankruptcy of Enron.
It is the largest=  US bankruptcy ever.
There are not one, but two official governmental inves= tigations of the company and further investigations are likely.
The bankers= , accountants and the lawyers are also going to get a hard look.
What has t= he market particularly bothered is the glaring oversight by Arthur Anderson=  (AA), one of the big five accounting firms.
Delta Airlines has been using = AA for over 50 years and they are looking for a new auditor.
Also, the cred= it rating agencies dropped the ball too.
One of them actually upgraded Enro= n's debt a few weeks before its demise.
What is the investing public to thi= nk?
Who can you trust?
Generally, investors understand that the Street's ad= vice needs to be viewed with a critical eye, but the accountants were suppo= sed to be looking out for investors.
It certainly makes you say hmmmmm...
The market hates uncertainty and the level of uncertainty has increased gre= atly and it is not likely to dissipate for some time.
Imagine the discussio= ns at the other accounting firms.
Companies are not going to be able to sli= p anything by their accountants from now on.
Standards are going to be toug= hened up and that may cause some pain for companies that have pushed the en= velope in the past.
In addition, the market is going to search and destroy = every company that has Enron-like qualities.
Off-balance sheet partnerships=  or structures, complicated financial statements and foreign domiciled tax = structures.
It started almost right away with the decimation of Enron's com= petitors, Williams (WMB), El Paso (EP), Mirant (MIR) and Calpine (CPN), who=  have had to sell assets and issue stock in order to repair their balance s= heets.
Some of those companies are trading as if we will never need power o= r natural gas again (EP is my favourite among these companies, as you know)= .
Next, the market had its day or so with the asbestos-infected companies a= nd then more recently proceeded to anyone with off-balance sheet assets or = a history of accounting indiscretions.
We had better get used to this sort = of roller-coaster existence.
With over 6,000 hedge funds, a hyper-active me= dia and market information available 24/7, the witch hunts will continue.
S= till, it is important to note a few things:=20 First, not all companies with off-balance sheet items are guilty of transgr= essions and not every company that acquires others for a living (a la Tyco)=  violates standard accounting principles.
In fact, nobody has proven (yet) = that Tyco has done anything improper.
The risk of impropriety makes people = sell, not the fact.
Second, regardless of whether your company is guilty of doing anything nast= y, if it plays in the same sand-box as a company that attracts the ire of i= nvestors, it is going down.
Period.
Full stop.
No matter if it is guilty of=  anything or not.
These are market events not business events.
Consider the=  pain and suffering experienced by El Paso (EP) thanks to Enron or Viacom (= VIA.b) thanks to Haliburton (HAL) and its asbestos exposure.

The MTM is from Dec 11, somewhat in the middle of all the termination dates.
You will have to ask Risk to get a TAGG run from the termination date.

I would suggest that we run TAGG, then take all deals of MTM over $50,000 and model them separately.
The rest of the small deals we would group using the TAGG run to value.
You might want to set a higher or lower threshold.
Please let me know.
Peter, We need to issue to the teams a termination status for each of the counterparties on the priority list, or would you prefer that groups contact Chris Christopher in Greg's absence to go through the details on termination status (this could prove a roadblock over the next few days).
At any rate, per our process, the teams need to sit down with legal before they start, to understand the situation.
",Responsibilities breakdown for clean-up
2834,"Hi Chris!
I followed up with the same IRS representative I spoke with in November regarding your missing cheque.
I wish I had better news for the holiday season.
Three traces were placed on your missing refund cheque and three times the trace has been rejected.
The IRS doesn't know why.
They are placing a formal inquiry into the matter.
The representative I spoke with has admitted that somebody on the IRS' end isn't doing what they are supposed to be doing and he promised me they'd get down to the matter.
I can only tell you that I will follow up again in January of the new year.
In the meantime, have a very Merry Holiday Season and a Wonderful New Year!
Best regards,
",IRS refund--update
2835,"Hi Chris,  As promised, I have phoned the IRS today and spoken with a representative who was able to tell me that the original request for the trace on your cheque on September 19 was rejected by their system on October 22.
He told me that he couldn't tell me why because the IRS aren't sure either why the system rejected it.
As such, a new request for a trace was placed on October 22 and now the IRS are asking us to wait until December 17.
The IRS told me that you should receive a letter called a 510C letter from them.
I have changed your address with the IRS from Texas to Calgary.
I would ask that when you receive this letter to fax a copy to my attention at 781-1825 for our files.
I know that this probably isn't the news you were hoping to hear, but at least it's some news.
I have made a note to follow up with the IRS again on December 17 and hopefully by then they will have good news in time for the holidays!
Again, don't hesitate to contact either Judy or myself should you hear anything further from the IRS, receive your cheque(!)
or have any other questions or concerns.
Kind regards,

2888,"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  PROS Revenue Management's Energy Web Seminar Series  a ""Resounding Success""  December 10, 2001-Houston- PROS Revenue Management, the world's leader in revenue management science and software, and the pioneer and dominant provider of revenue management to the airline and energy industries, today announced the success of its Energy Profit Optimization Web Seminar Series held December 5-7, 2001.
Each seminar in the series discussed the benefits of PROS commercial optimization systems in the natural gas industry.
Each seminar included case studies which provided participants an insight to the practical applications of PROS science-based optimization systems.
Focused on pipelines, storage, and trading, these seminars enabled participants from various areas of the energy industry to take advantage of pricing and revenue optimization best practices.
""These seminars were a resounding success,"" says Matt Johnson, PROS' Senior VP of Energy.
""PROS is continuing to take the leadership role for transfer of our mature revenue management science and technology into the energy industry.
Based on the positive feedback of key energy first-movers, we anticipate several more of these innovative, interactive seminars in 2002.
These sessions allowed attendees to have access to free, informative business case studies reflecting state-of-the-art energy revenue management.""
The PROS Trading Optimization System can increase gas trading profitability by 10-15% by generating the optimal routing of supply to market given all pipeline contract constraints, gas purchase and sale obligations, and trading opportunities.
The system recommends optimal spot gas buy/sell strategies and provides real-time physical position and opportunity cost data between any two points on the pipeline network.
The result is the reduction of the gas scheduling process to less than 60 seconds.
The PROS Storage Revenue Management System has been shown to increase revenues from the sale of storage capacity by 7-25% after initial implementations.
This system provides pipelines, storage marketers and traders with the ability to maximize revenue from the sale of storage services and contracts.
It provides the comprehensive ability to analyze the value of storage using PROS' state-of-the-art revenue management science and to execute and track those deals in real-time.
The PROS Transportation Revenue Management System has demonstrated a revenue lift of 7-15% for firm transportation services in both open-season and negotiated sales environments.
It allows natural gas pipelines to maximize revenue from the sale of transportation capacity.
The system uses PROS' mature forecasting technology to predict demand for transportation contracts and forecast the customer utilization of existing contracts.
PROS' price modeling and network optimization technology is used to provide pipeline capacity marketers with an optimal marketing plan that maximizes revenue from the sale of available capacity.
These products are based on the PROS Enterprise RM Platform, which uses world leading science, forecasting and optimization to generate revenue and profits for PROS' clients worldwide.
The Platform is high performance, distributed computing, using parallelized, highly scalable technology.
This architecture will support the high performance, high availability, real time, and mission critical applications of our clients.
PROS' advanced architecture supports data intensive and calculation intensive, science-based enterprise solutions.
PROS 9th Annual Pricing and Revenue Optimization Conference will be March 3-7, 2002.
This premiere event will feature industry leaders participating in presentations, panel discussions, and product workshops.
Join industry colleagues, academics, and representatives from the international business community at large to discuss relevant topics specific to the energy industry and to the practice of revenue management.
More information and formal invitations are coming soon.

2904,"Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.
No hand-outs were provided.
Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity Topock  540 mmcf/d Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d Needles 800 mmcf/d Wheeler 800 mmcf/d  New Receipt Points Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d Both will be available around Feb 1  Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.
Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.
New Calculation, Changes and Display Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.
SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.
Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.
Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.
Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.
Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.
They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.
OFO Declaration Name changes from overnomination Can declare before any Cycle Provide 2 hour notice Post on Gas Select Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select  Windows Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system Calculation based on noms which does not work well.
Lots of complaints.
People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.
Eliminating point specific calculation.
Open system to Max Oper.
Limits or Contractual Limits.
Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.
No changes to Wheeler Ridge.
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.
If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.
Scheduling Changes-Nov 1 Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .
No direct dial-up.
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle Copy confirmed noms All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.
However, can still make  changes.
Can still upload new files.
2 Hour Notice Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.
Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.
Gas Select is official notification.
Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.
Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.
OFO's can be declared intraday.
Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.
Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.
Don't want to go back and forth.
This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.
Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.
Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.
Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.
Generators need to revise expected usage.
Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.
Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:  Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.
Will allocate prorata.
Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.
In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut.
Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles.
For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.
Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.
For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.
For example:           Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2 Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1 Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4 Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4  In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.
; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.
Winter Balancing Rules Effective Nov 1-March 31 No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements 50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;) 70% of daily usage depending on storage level 70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min 90% of daily usage depending on storage level 90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.

If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,  Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.
Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group) Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.
2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.
As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.
Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement, Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.
Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.

Late Friday  night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of  HPL.
The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will  be 11,300/d.

2974,"Steve,   I really need the Oasis and PGE transport contracts assigned to HPL by July  2000.
Currently, we are buying gas in the Waha region as HPLC.
But since  our transport is under ENA, we have to enter an additional transaction where  HPL sales the gas to ENA at the point of purchase.
ENA then transports the  gas to a delivery point.
If the gas is sold to another counterparty, an  additional transaction between ENA and HPL must be entered at the delivery  point.
This causes great difficulty in balancing out the pipelines and  completing the scheduling in reasonable time.
Plus, it just doesn't make  sense to keep the transport under ENA since we transact all other deals as  HPLC.
Please let me know when we can get these contracts assigned.
Thanks for your help.

2981,"In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related  to the Cleburne plant.
However, for October 2000, the plant was down the  majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing  money to Tenaska IV.
I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the  calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk.
(Please see the attached  schedule.)

2982,"In February, 539,594 Mmbtu were allocated to the our index purchase from HPLR  Liquids at King Ranch.
This allocation resulted in a large physical  unaccounted for loss.
Effectively, the gas was being purchased twice in our  systems.
In addition, a sale to the Liquids group, which should have been  zero, was brokered with a purchase from Swift (2500 Mmbtu/day), resluting in  additional gas being allocated to the HPLR Liquids purchase contract.
I have  attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in  February.
This schedule also reports the daily volumes for March which will  need to be adjusted.
I have calculated (based on estimates) that we should  have only purchased about 88,000 from the Liquids group at King Ranch for  February.
See the following:  Booked to HPLR Liquids: 539,574  18,606/day Purch by HPLC @ WH:  379,108  13,073/day Incorrect Liquids Sale:    72,500  2,500/day      Adjusted purch from Liquids:   87,986  3,034/day   We usually input a purchase of 2,500 Mmbtu/day from HPLR Liquids at the  tailgate.
We can increase this to 3,000/day for March.
The majority of gas in the 3-Rivers system is transported to the King Ranch  plant through HGPL.
Some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLC,  some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by HPLR Liquids, and three  producers have the option to either sell their gas to HPLC at the wellhead or  to process their gas and sell the residue to HPLC at the tailgate of the  plant.
It is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated  correctly among parties related to these transactions.
The attached schedule  should assist in doing this.
I have reported the meters at which HPLC buys  wellhead gas.
The movement of this gas through HGPL and King Ranch should be  kept seperate from the gas purchased by the Liquids group.
A transport usage  ticket can be used to show the transfer of HPLC's gas from King Ranch to HPL.

How are things going for you?
Is the market loving you?
We have been really busy.
We sold our house after 2 weeks on the market.
I  don't think I had it underpriced.
I looked at the average $/sq ft for sales  in our neighborhood for the last 6 months and I was pretty high above the  average.
Anyway, we got what we wanted and made a little money, so we were  happy.
Two days after we sold our house, Tonya found the one she wanted in  Oaks of Devonshire.
It's over at Louetta and I-45, just before The Thicket.
It's a little bigger than we were looking for (3100 sq ft), but it's got a  great game room/sunroom for the kids.
It was built in 86, so it needs a  little work.
But that's ok with me.
Anyway, we are closing on both houses  on Monday and moving Tuesday and Wednesday.
We will have you and Linda over  for lunch or dinner one of these days.
We also had tubes put into Jake's  ears this month.
We hated having to do that, but it has really made a  difference.
He had a constant ear infection since October.
Now you can tell  that he feels so much better.
He's learning more and more each day.
We have  nothing that is ""Jake proof"".
Even those plastic locks you put on cabinets  don't hold him.
He knows that if you keep yanking on the door over and over  that it will eventually slip or break and then your in.
I'm going to install  pad locks on the cabinets at the new house.
We'll see if that stops him.
Anyway, everybody's doing well.
I will be alot better after we finish this  house business.
I don't feel so good when I'm writing all those checks.

3004,"To forecast Entex:  We have a database that contains the citygate volumes by day, with the low  and high temps for each day.
When we get a weather report for the new day,  we enter the projected low temp and the spread into the file.
The database  is sorted by that information with a +/- 2 degrees on the temps, and provides  an average volume for that criteria.
(For example:  With temps of 40-60, the  sort would produce a list of the volumes pulled for each day with a low of 38  to 42 degrees and a temperature spread of 20 to 22 degrees.
An average is  then calculated from that volumetric data.
In this case, the average is  calculated to 259,000 Mmbtu.)
Upon calculating the average, we then apply  information we obtain through daily business and adjust that estimate.
Things to consider:  if weather is cloudy or sunny, wet or dry;  wind chill;   Entex's obligation on Midcon;  Entex's recent operating procedures;  Entex  takes versus our prior estimates (have we been under or overestimating  volumes each day), etc.
Additionally, since we only see about 30% of the meters, we apply a factor to  estimate the remaining 70%.
If we have an unaccounted volume for a few days  that is fairly consistent (and we have determined that the ua4 has not been  caused by something else), we may adjust the factor to bring the estimates  more in line.

3022,"Cathy, I want to recap our conversation yesterday because, after I thought about it, I still do not  understand the issue with 20Q and its PRM:    A credit reserve was set up for bad debts for $5,577,900 and credited to account 25100300 Prudency Reserve.
It is my understanding that this was the only way to book this transaction.
But I do not understand why this was booked in a PRM account and not booked to the Allowance for Bad Debts account.
Also, when I reduce the 25100300 account balance by the $5,577,900 that was booked there, my difference doubles to $11,155,800 (see attached spreadsheet).
So was account 25100300 originally credited or debited by the $5,577,900?
If it was originally debited and I remove that debit, then the PRM will roll.
Also, will there be anyway to move this transaction out of the PRM accounts in order to effectively roll these accounts every month?

3040,"John,  I wanted to clarify my e-mail I sent from work I don't think I was specific enough.
1.
On the day ahead position that hourly would manage, lets say it is in the short term ercot book.
In ettera if you go to that book you will not find that trade.
So the only way to adjust it is to go and do it in the portal.
2.
Also if you have a day ahead position and we manage it hourly,if we were to adjust it for balday, for instance if we were long 50mw in the pool and we sold 25mw balday it would reflect the change.
But if we came back and did another trade and submitted to xml it would change back to 50mw.
3.
We need to change how we show a buy from frontera.
We now have to buy from frontera and then sale back to them.
This was a way to fix the problem short term but it should not be a long term solution.

They had a number of questions regarding the contract terms and seems like they want to sign something by week end.
I need clarification on a few issues that they raised.
We need to give them answers tommorow.
Proposed Contract terms:  1.
Houston Zone: 1.95 MW +/- 15% per settlement Interval  2.
South Zone: 2.75 MW +/- 10% per settlement Interval  3.
North Zone: 15 MW +/- 10% per settlement Interval  4.
West Zone: 1.75 MW +/- 10% per settlement Interval  ** BOC going to Balancing Energy (+4% charges) outside the band **  1.
Interruptibility - BOC wanted to understand the mechanics.
Specifically, they wanted to know how Enron would work with them to maximize curtailment opportunities.
They also wanted to know the quantity they could curtail (e.g.
If deal is 15 MW +/- 10%, can BOC curtail 16.5 MW, or just 15 MW).
Also, do they pay any penalty when they curtail (4%, etc.)
2.
Scheduled maintenance - Can they sell contract power a week forward.
Is there any penalty for not being within the band during those hours.
3.
BOC wants a fixed price quote for all Ancillaries and ERCOT Passthroughs.
However they want the ability to unwind this fixed price position should they feel they are better off with ERCOT market prices once the market becomes more transparent.
What is Enron's ability to provide such a service?
4.
BOC doesnt like the 4% charge in excess of Balancing Energy everytime they are outside the Quantity Band.
They said that they dont want to pay more when prices are high and they are outside the band.
They want a fixed fee instead of 4% of BES price.
Given the bands we have placed in the contract, BOC was outside the band  a.

My probems were (1) the issue of possible or apparent  affiliate preference and (2) the need for adequate documentation of ""surplus  line pack.""

3053,"Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any  ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.
In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.
Apparently, a bunch of  utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to  figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.
If the RR owns  its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be  able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.
In other words,  the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.
If we did that, Dave  thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.
Since our lines cross or  parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that  would be foolish.
I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was  interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW  without too much pain.
If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to  suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.
Assuming we  can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the  appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW  should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we  decide to go forward.

Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our  going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K.   I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and  then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.
To counter  that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the ""relationship  issue.""
I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals  with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.
That should be a big deal to  him and may get us the resolution we need.
To push that I need three things  from you: 1.
Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like  Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?
Obviously if we have  already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much  weight.

Are you all OK with the threat?
I suspect that our threat to quit doing  business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that  Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain.

Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to  put our dollars in?
He may propose something specific and I'd like to be  able to agree that we will ""work with them"" on future deals.

3063,"There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the  close of our meeting today.
I'll try to restate them, and add my initial  thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.
Q 1.
Can TW use ""negotiated rate"" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?
A.
Yes.
Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were  certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.
The only restriction  is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an  alternative to negotiated rates.
We hope to use negotiated rate agreements  for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are  executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it  will be under recourse rate contracts.
I guess that means that in the cert.
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given  the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to  sell the full 150.
We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the  capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a  combination of both.
Q 2.
Can we give prospective customers a ""cafeteria style"" menu of options  (to steal Jeff's term), like the following:  1.
5 yr. neg.
rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or  whatever number we decide on)  2.
10 y. neg.
rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges  3.
15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah  4 .
15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly  this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and  fuel retainage percentages)  A.  I think the answer here is ""yes.""
Whatever options we come up with for  1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.
Susan and Steve  Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated  rate options and stick to them.
Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach  could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking  our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a  7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).
I'm not sure that would be  a bad thing, but we need to think about it.
We need to be sure we can tell a  customer ""no"" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for  the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.
I think we can lay out options  of our choosing and then enforce a ""no substitutions"" policy (this is  sticking with the ""cafeteria"" theme) but we need to be sure.
Q.3.
If we can use the ""cafeteria options"" approach, how much flexibility do  we have in structuring the options?
A:  This one is hard.
We need to be sure that the price and term we choose  to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.
We don't want to  be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at  $.58 instead of $.60.
Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have  discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we  can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better  deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?
I.e., could we  deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by

3065,"Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else  FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it.
The Thursday rehearing  order dramatically changes how the ""shipper must have title"" rule applies to  acquisitions of upstream capacity.
I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly  allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity  under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules.
FERC specifically held that   the ""shipper must have title"" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe  treats the acquired capacity ""as though it were part of its own system"".
(p.  61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity  from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be  done without advance Commission approval.
Now, FERC explains that it did  not intend a ""blanket waiver"" of the shipper must have title policy.
Pipes  can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only  if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational  needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism.
If the  acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service  under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the ""must  have title"" policy is required (see FN 20 and text).
We are right back to  where we started.
I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely  to grant waivers of the ""must have title"" policy than in the past, but I  don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and  resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.

3069,"A couple of additional thoughts on this morning's conversation:    1.  if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and  receipt point capacity issues, why not bet the whole farm and try to hold  onto the whole 150 mm/d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived  value goes up?
We could tell Calpine ""no"" on their bid and hold them off for  several months ""negotiating"" if that's what we thought would lead to the best  value.
I don't personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its  where our logic leads in the extreme, so we'd better be prepared to explain  why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart.
2.
We'll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids  that come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d  for awhile.
I've thought about it a bit more and I'm pretty sure you're not  going to like the answer.
First, FERC says we've got to have a recourse rate  in place for all capacity, new or old.
One reason is that there needs to be  a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases.
We have the option  on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new  incrementally designed rate.
We are going with the existing tariff rate on  RedRock.
Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all  purposes.
FERC's logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock  capacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue  shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW's overall rates, because the  costs of all TW's facilities--including the new project--will be considered

I do not read it as forcing the  rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price  for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.
I think we  can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal  based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index  mechanism.
I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index  mechanism is worth ""x cents"" to us and require a discounted recourse rate  bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.
Agreed?
Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at  a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this  issue.

The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant  as well as the pipeline.
The power plant could be located on Isleta land  adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.
Thus, the power  plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without  ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.
PNM would not be necessary to move  power to DOE.

Tino reports  that ""DOE is OK with the deal"" and the next step is negotiating the power  contract itself.

Tino,  Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill  Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the ""sole source"" procurement approach to  DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia.
Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject  only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the  public interest.
Tino believes that the combination of significant Native  American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price  that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the ""public interest""  standard.
Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall  structure of Dennis' proposal.

3118,"Another Tino-gram.
DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo  demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.
Tino didn't  know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak  usage, or what.
The PNM tariff for govt.
service is priced at $7.16/KW of  ""demand above 10,000kw during peak period""  (peak period is daytime) so I  assume that is how it is calculated.
If that is the tariff (""Schedule  4000B"") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because  that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.
It is also  interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B  energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something).
Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an  incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total  delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.
This is not as good as the 7 cent  number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.
If  the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is  $.0576/kwh.
Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm  these numbers.
That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you  and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.
Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the  Cobisa Belen project is dead.

3119,"I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02  for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large  industrials.
That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have  to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail  markets start to open up.
One more thing to factor in.
I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to  talk about Langley's ""sole source"" procurement strategy with DOE.
I hope to  get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt.
contracts lawyers to discuss  their theory.
We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole  source strategy is really a high risk approach.
I'm not sure where that  would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE  into opening the power plant up for bids.
Langley does not appear interested  in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would  probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning.
Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me  that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions  (potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland  outsourcing strategy) and ENA.
The ENA involvement would be particularly  important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the  specifications/economics that would result.
I'm probably engaging in wishful  thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat  exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics  from the model that James ran.
If we think this thing is a potentially  viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab  Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA ""from the bottom up,"" or through  Stan ""from the top down"" to get hooked into a deal team over there.

3124,"I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few   innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal.
I attach a revised draft of  the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think  we need to make to keep it accurate.
First, AA only listed two of the four  agreements that comprise the deal.
They apparently forgot that we had  created a second SBA.
Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the  transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.
You will recall  that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA.
Second, AA's bullet no.
4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does  not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term  of the agreement.
That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the  Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is  a form of purchase option.
That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets  describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA  looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful  in drafting bullet no.
4.
My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone  but to add an ""except for"" reference at the beginning of bullet no.
4.
Third, AA's draft of bullet nos.
5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous  references to ""other agreements"" and ""additional agreements"" respectively.
Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete,  these references in bullet nos.
5 and 6 were also innacurate.
Now that I  have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've  clarified the bullets by adding the ""other than those agreements referenced  above"" language to both bullets.
The couple of other changes in bullet 5  simply clarify the meaning.
Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to  delete MKM and myself.
I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter,  but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.
Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.
Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports  anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the  top guy has signed.
Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these  matters.

3129,"Just got an update on the project that won't go away.
Dennis has a meeting  lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.
He is going to pitch the  project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read  ""financed by"") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third  parties (read ""Enron""?).
Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get  a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates,  even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas  load.
How did he do it?
Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics  using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.
Dennis'  argument is going to be:  ""I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and  the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you.""
""You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average,  you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or  escalate, you lose.""
Either way, your reliability improves and you kick  PNM in the shins.""
Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on  this.
By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign,  and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even  more publicity.
You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely  to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or  cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.
They think his real  angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor  out there!!
Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got  hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.
I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together  to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.
Other than that, I  just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the  project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be  interested in the design/build on all of it.

We are still discussing it with ECS and  can make whatever changes are appropriate.
Note that the letter agreement  ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement.
That article,  you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that  would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when  their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor  offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period  demand charges.
Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned  out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee  to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off  line.
The load management service has to do with operational management of  the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas  transportation or storage service.

You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic  understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more  responsive to what they want to ask you about.
If you do get stumped, try to  defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can  answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.
By doing  that , you should be able to get them the information they need without  having them cross examine a bunch of other people.
Inevitably, if you ask  enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers.
Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss  generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.
Please  let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.

They are still negotiating  with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.
The size of the  plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.
Tino has been  ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls  apart.
He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it  related to the pipeline right of way.
The have a binding 20 year agreement  with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly  payment.
I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the  ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.

",TW Gallup - Gas Conversion Pricing
3166,"On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old ""Texas Eastern"" rule  that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for  transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.
The  new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to  FERC first.
The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still  prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be  financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.
Interestingly,  the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired  capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant  to its capacity release program.
The order is silent on whether the price  cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.
While we are still  reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd  emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority  thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.
For example,  the ""Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures"" dated Feb. 3, 2000  provides Dave and Steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense  obligations.

Additional Insurance  In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there  are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we  will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption  insurance when we go operational on gas.

",Accomplishments
3200,"Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August  and beyond.
1.
We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's  transport to be close to $1 million/ month.
2.
I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her  here.
If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El  Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our  customers.
The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.
3.
The spreads out West have been huge this summer.
We were able to take  advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very  difficult time.
4.
When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding  down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on  management duties.
5.
Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day  off.
She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several  different jobs at a time.
6.
The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.
I would estimate  that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million  to the desk.

3202,"Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams  for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate  these paths in Unify.
In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity  between the systems.

Please feel free to attend and give your opinions.
","""Auto-Pathing"" Buy/Sells"
3203,"I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.
I talked to  Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users  perspective.
My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to  how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over  different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.
We  can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.
I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did  not want to forget them.
1.
When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how  will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.
2.
Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes  at a late time?
We could do the rest over the phone.
3.
On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it  would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.
I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.
I'm sure  there are a lot of others.
Thanks.
",Contract Exchange
3204,"I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene  this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.
Mary  has requested that we do the following:  1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order  summary.
2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.
3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of  calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.
4) Finalize sponsor support elements.
This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not  resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30  days to review the model and budget when submitted.
We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the  contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors  to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

3212,"John, I jjust reviewed the interconnection memo from Claudia.
Once again it  is weak on the situation and our remedies.
Can you help Jose try to pull  this together.
",Interconnection
3213,"Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:  1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to  meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve  margin.
We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above  220 MW.
(Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)
2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full  time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the  transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring.
[ Please  describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal  detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how  long this will take.
I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the  corrective measures.]
3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate  220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if  dipatched above 220 MW.
If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they  are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas  is ready by April 01.
We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue  Garvin flex months.
Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition  about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem  is cleared.
If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced  fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or  seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our  availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.
Any data you can provide will be helpful.

3217,"Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and  helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history.
However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as  I understand it.
The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically  about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from  parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate.
Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along  the lines of:  1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of  damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?
2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?
3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid  documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?
4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement  which was payable by EPE?
Could the process be expedited to avert a  liquidity crisis?
5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a  spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?
6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they  failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of  the agreements?
7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to  back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under  the PPA?
9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable  by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?
10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance  protect us in any of these instances?
(Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity  facility provides some comfort to the lenders)   John, stop me if you think I am off track.

3244,"Tracy and James,  Elaine and Phil thought it would be nice to include this summary page in the plan review package for Stan's review next week.
I think Rod mentioned that Stan has set a target for Phil of 5.0MM for 2002.
Please advise if this is still valid because Phil personally has not heard that from Stan.
The numbers that we have in Adaytum match the $4.4 MM net contribution.
The remaining $0.6MM are salary offsets on NNG.
42P does not have employees and they use NNG employees.
When they do that, NNg charges the salaries of the employees for the applicable # of hours to 42P.
Therefore,  42P covers expenses that NNG would have to bear otherwise.
Phil feels that the $0.6MM of salaries offsets should be counted toward the 5.0 target since it's a benefit that 42P brings to NNG.
James and I talked about this on the phone.
Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Thanks!

3247,"Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Unclaimed Property Reporting to the States.
The Corporate Secretary Division centralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.
I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Account, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, and reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.
It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the applicable state before the deadline.

3249,"After the budget session, I thought I needed to make sure one more process is started and in order.
Insurance costs have risen and there may be a disconnect between expectations and actual results.
I would like to think that we can develop the proper insurance program for Wessex and other Operating Companies in a short time.
I think we will need to determine what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed and then what is the right information to send out in the request for quotes.
This is so that everyone is dealing with the same information.
I would argue that we should be able to price the deal in the market and then give the group program 	a right to match the deal.
I think the next step is yours, to tell us what levels of insurance and deductibles are needed  and then follow that up with the information 	to go out in the RFP.
However, it will be necessary to establish some ground rules.
In the event the Operating Company (OC) wishes  to secure a ""market price"" for their insurance: 	1.
The OC may nominate a broker to secure pricing.
The Broker is subject to CRM's (Corporate Risk Management working for EGS-Enron Global Services) 	approval.
Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld.
An appeal of an adverse decision from CRM to the CEO of EGS is possible.
2.
CRM will specify and the operating company will supply to CRM,  the necessary underwriting information.
3.
The OC will specify the types of insurance and coverages,  limits, and deductibles they require for their business.
4.
CRM will provide the underwriting data and coverage specifications to the competing brokers.
5.
The competing brokers will be directed by and report to CRM during the bid process and thereafter, if the broker is appointed.
6.
CRM will receive the proposals from the brokers, evaluate and report the results, with recommendations, to the operating company and the appropriate senior 	manager within Enron.
7.
OC will elect the program and price they  prefer and CRM will have the right to provide such coverage or direct the appropriate broker in the placement of a 	separate program.
8.
For locations outside the U.S. the OC may request using their nominated broker for servicing their day to day insurance needs, provided the broker becomes 	a ""correspondent"" within the established Enron Broker Network.
This will ensure continued co-ordination of the insurance programs.
I think a progam like this can get everyone closer to a satisfactory conclusion in the process.
Please let me know your thoughts on the proposed program, 	because obviously we need to get started ASAP.

3254,"On tuesday of this week after EOTT's staff meeting, I was made aware of a potential environmental estimate problem (too big).
I am looking at ways of potentially dealing with the problem so that Lawrence will feel comfortable not booking a reserve in the 3rd qtr, which may have consequences on the plans we have underway to recapitalize the entity.
This means coming up with an answer very quickly.
There are a number of potential alternatives and I am sure there are more than I will attempt to lay out here.
1) We could simply make a contribution to EOTT for the sole purpose of environmental cleanup, and if unused will be returned.
Seems like an expense item, but doable.
2) We could provide an insurance policy to EOTT to provide for environmental expenses in excess of the existing policy, for a fee.
Better expense treatment (we get to manage the reserve) and appears to cover the EOTT issue.
Because this is an affiliated deal, I guess it would have to go through the audit committee.
Potentially the captive could be used.
3) Provide an accounting answer that might give EOTT a one-time gain to offset the one time reserve set-up.
i.e., there is a least an argument that the recapitalization proposed will result in the extinguishment of a portion of the debt on the books represented by the API's.
Since we are getting a conversion of less than a dollar for dollar deal, this should be doable.
For Lawrence:  Jim Bouillion has indicated that the insurance proposal may have merit, and so I will need some input from you regarding the coverage that exists now and what we would want going forward.
If you want us to talk directly with Susan, we will.
I am thinking that you are getting a quote for increasing the cap on the existing policy and that we could give you the same deal, or maybe even slightly better, to satisfy the audit committee.
I am obviously looking for any help that I can get here, so if there any more ideas I would like to hear them.

Jessica - the 2002 Capital Slide has been revised to be consistent with the NNG disclosure schedule.
The decommissioning forecast is up by $1.6 MM, however since this is funded by the decommissioning trust it should not be an issue.
Tracy - Do you have a time and agenda set for the Nov. 1 dry run of the budget presentation?
I may be sitting in for Piro so please keep me posted as to what the plan is.
Rod - you asked for some detail on our IT capital expenditures.
The file IT_Teresa includes the requested detail.
Note that in our UE-115 ratecase we were authorized to expend up to $96.8 MM for the  2000-2002 budget years.
This is a balancing account, such that if we don't expend the money we have to refund it to customers.
As an fyi - I've pasted in below the language from our UE-115 Stipulation on IT costs.
Q.
What is the basis for the stipulation relating to issue S-45, CIS / IT Disallowance?
A.
After a Staff review of new IT systems and their associated capital costs, Staff has determined PGE's capital costs for new IT systems to be prudent.
As a result, the Parties agreed to full recovery of PGE's IT investments, subject to a Staff audit.
PGE will place into base rates 100% of the 2002 revenue requirement related to the 2000, 2001, and 2002 capital additions for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.
The 2002 revenue requirement included in base rates will be trued-up to the actual revenue requirement for the CIS/IT capital costs.
OPUC Staff will audit PGE's actual capital expenditures for the CIS/IT capital items listed below.
1.
Customer information system.
2.
Enterprise resources planning (ERP) system.
3.
Network meter reading (NMR) backbone and data store (excluding the meters).
4.
Miscellaneous capitalized information technology costs.
Some of the forecasted 2000-2002 capital additions may be delayed until 2003.
Delayed costs can also be recovered, subject to the same Staff audit procedures and standards.
Only those costs that are reasonable and prudent will be authorized for inclusion in the ""actual"" revenue requirement calculation.
Accordingly, customers will receive a refund for any costs PGE does not expend or costs the OPUC finds imprudent.

3276,"Hello Tracy,  I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and Hoang this week related to the project.
On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.
I know that you guys have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that are committed to the project.
This is due to the fact that they currently have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the project.
It is having an impact on the timeline.
The home office model could be a lot further along if some of the required information was delivered as requested.
Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.
It is important that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.
We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full production.
This individual should be identified and running the administration duties as soon as possible.
My fear is that without proper ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.
We've had some technical issues with the production and development environment.
Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact on the timeline.
There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.
Much time has been spent on gathering business process information from various people which has caused a delay in the model development.
I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and result in a successful implementation.
Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if you would like to discuss this.

3282,"Tracy:  Sorry to bother you with this one again -  in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.
In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e.
expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)?

3291,"Tracy,  Over the past few months, Rositza has been researching where the rebates related to Operations have been booked because Phil had earmarked them specifically to assist us in achieving our stretch target.
The rebates are not hitting Operations cost centers, and for numerous reasons from Accounting, they cannot be reclassified into the Operations hierarchies.
Since the rebates received are outside of Operations and Phil should get credit for them, I am reducing our stretch for the upcoming forecast for the rebates actually recorded through September and those expected for Q4.
This is a total of $1.0MM.
If you need documentation, I can forward Rositza's research to you.
Let me know if you have questions.
The ""ETS"" forecast we will submit for Operations will only include what will show up in that column for actuals at year end.
It includes our IBIT estimate for co.'s 1202, 184, 42P, 1195.
Any other amounts we have carried there in previous forecasts will be moved to the pipeline where we expect to see the actuals.
This forecast should represent our best estimate of where we will actually end up for the year (as of today!).
We continue to monitor spending closely, and will adjust next month if necessary.

3303,"Tracy  For VP level & above, I had the team pull by individual a recap of payroll information from SAP.
This extract shows all the ""current""  payroll buckets that contain some type of reportable compensation.
We then took that information & broke it into ""fixed "" and ""variable"" pay components.
The attached spreadsheet provides you an individual/job group summary for the ""fixed"" vs. ""variable"" pay components on a consolidated basis.
The ""variable"" pay amounts include ad-hoc payments for options, annual/retention bonus payments, tax settlements/refunds, etc.
Based on our conversation, my sense is that for budgeting purposes, you will need to utilize the ""fixed"" total amounts.
PLEASE NOTE - while the ""fixed"" pay components have been annualized, the ""variable"" pay components represent only those amounts recorded in the payroll system to date.
Also, I understand there may be changes to the flex dollar amounts - but I do not yet know the details.
I've checked with Executive Compensation to determine whether there might be a change in the Flexperq amounts - am still waiting for input.
I will advise you of any changes I hear with regard to these elements.
Additionally, on the fixed side, you should also budget some merit dollars - I would suggest 4-5%.
We do not know the amount yet - but I think that should be consistent with past practice.

It appears, at this point in time, that we have been able to clear up and cover all the unplanned expenditures, except for a remaining stretch of approximately $1,000,000.
We are working with all entities within ETS Operations on NNG and TW to find ways and means to cover this remaining stretch between the two companies (TW) and (NNG) during the month of December.
Since late October, Barney and his team have uncovered expenses on TW in the amount of approximately $3 million that was not covered in the Fourth Quarter forecast.
We have cleaned up all but the remaining $1 million.
Dan and Barney have both held meetings face to face with the parties involved in forecasting, or lack of it, and are implementing corrective actions.
We really appreciate the massive effort all personnel are taking to help alleviate this situation and we within OSS have implemented tighter controls and reviews on all the Business Units.
We will initiate weekly flash reviews and monitor closely the processing of all expense invoices during the month of December.

I have yet another request for which I need your input.
Causey is reviewing his budgets/direct reports, and would like to get the most current headcount numbers for the accounting groups in your business unit(s).
What I mean by accounting groups includes everyone whose superior ultimately reports to Causey.
For instance, this would include the traditional Accounting/Reporting departments, Tax departments, and Transaction Support departments.
It should NOT include any settlements/mid-office groups (for example, Sally Beck's world).
I say ""department"" because I don't want just accountants, but everyone who is in that dept, i.e.
admins, clerks, etc.
If you have a question on any unique situation, please just give me a call and we'll discuss.
The data needs to be as recent as possible.
Hopefully, I can get this as of July 31/August 1.
If you have more recent data, that would be great.
At a bare minimum, I need total headcount as described by group (acct, reporting, tax, etc.)
It would also be useful to get as much detail as possible, i.e.
by sub-group, by personnel level, etc., but I know that may be a challenge given the timing of the request.
Additionally, if you can provide me with a ""current estimate"" for the groups you report, that would be ideal.
I know that the official CE doesn't go to that level, but I'm betting that most of you have something that projects your G&A by cost center (or group/dept) for 2001, as of the 2nd CE.
The headcount information is a must have, and the 2001 cost estimate is secondary, although I'd like to ask everyone to strive to provide both.
If you can't provide estimated costs for the groups you report, please call me so we can discuss.
Speaking of the timing, I need this by Wednesday, August 29 at 12 noon.
This will be given to Rick on Thursday morning, so I'll need some time to consolidate the data and to ask you all any further questions.

Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.
Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.
Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.

Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.
Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent.

3344,"October 24, 2001  To: Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation Customers and Shippers  Re: System Imbalance Notice  Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its system throughout the month.
Effective immediately, shippers are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances and return to a balanced position.
Absent voluntary compliance, it may become necessary for Transco to suspend make-up deliveries for the remainder of the month.
Additionally, effective October 26, 2001 and until further notice, Transco will institute more restrictive practices at its pooling points.
Transco will reduce the 4% tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e.
deliveries into the pools are less than receipts away from the pools).
Shippers with positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will be held to the 4% tolerance levels.
Transco will not enforce these pool imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however, Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified above by the ID2 nomination cycle.
Transco may proactively decrease markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points.

3349,"Everybody got alot accomplished today on our firedrill.
Yeah Team!
Here's a quick update:  Maria, located the missing ""DRI Operating"" agreements and correspondence.
See the fax I sent to your computer.
The bad news, it is a 1 year, evergreen agreement with 60 days notice by either party prior to the end of the contract year (i.e.
60 days notice prior to October 31, 2002) to terminate.
Looks like paying them for post petition gas and reject the contract may be the best answer for the estate.
She also uncovered another listing of global contract numbers that may be the key to finding the other missing agreements in LiveLink.
Chris, has been reviewing Wade's TCO data and comparing it to pipeline gathering invoices.
I can't answer your question about whether we are making money yet, but we are getting really close to the answer.
He is getting all the data together for the sales pitch now, so that everything will go smoothly next week.
He is also attacking all the other companies that relate to the producers.
Wade & Robin & Chris are working on the Dominion producers to try to see if they can approximate the high level summary retroactive reallocation volume adjustments that Chris has prepared.
I will forward you Wade's email from Dominion that says that any additional detail is tied up in bankruptcy court.
When they get done, we will be able to approximate what the $ impact is in pushing the producers back to 12/3/02.
Your paralegal & Maria really made alot of progress on finding the contracts.
I think we are up to a 100% success ratio going forward.
They still need to go back and try to find the missing ones.
We sent you a ""big gift"" of contracts to your D.C. office for Monday delivery.
NY Ed begged me to make sure that the DRI letter gets out on Friday.
I told him that he was going to have to argue 120 new cases in front of the court.
Hee Hee  Our Ed is taking vacation on Friday, June 28th.
We will need to make sure everything gets done so that the letter can be signed on Thursday.
I did not get anything done on the other things we discussed yesterday.
Have a great weekend, Ruth

Columbia's system is connected to CMS Panhandle via multiple points in western Ohio.
Columbia intends to offer this as a ""seamless"" service, whereby Columbia would manage the nomination and billing service for this linked path between CMS Panhandle and Columbia.
Due to the multiple transportation paths available into Columbia's system via the CMS Panhandle system, Columbia is requesting that interested parties submit their requests for capacity and service in accordance with the terms set forth below.
In the event the preferred receipt path is beyond the service that can be provided by either CMS Panhandle or Columbia, Columbia may look to extend the supply path, as necessary, by including other transportation providers.
LENGTH OF OPEN SEASON  The open season period will commence on Friday, October 12, 2001, and close at 4:30 p.m. E.T.
on Friday, December 14, 2001.
During the open season, interested parties desiring service should submit a request form in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in this notice.
SERVICE DESCRIPTION  Subject to the terms of this open season and depending on the interest expressed through completed request forms, Columbia will evaluate the possibility of using either existing or new capacity for service under its Firm Transportation Service (""FTS"") Rate Schedule from its west receipt points into Ohio, located at Crossroads, Cecil, Maumee, and Lebanon.
The open season targets Market Areas 1 through 9 and 15 in Ohio and Northern Kentucky, respectively.
Columbia would also consider requests for summer service (April-October), where practical.
Columbia also will evaluate non-binding proposals from existing customers to turn back firm capacity under existing service agreements that may reduce the amount of capacity for which facilities would need to be constructed.
However, any such proposal(s) would have to be compatible with the specific terms of any project that Columbia may ultimately propose.
CONTRACT TERM/SERVICE COMMENCEMENT  The suggested minimum contract term that Columbia will consider is ten (10) years.
The minimum term will depend on the need, or not, for new facilities to be constructed.
Parties submitting a request form should indicate a preferred service commencement date, with the earliest commencement date being December 31, 2001 (if existing capacity on the Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if necessary, other transportation providers, can be used to accommodate the requested service).
RATES  Rates will be derived in accordance with Columbia's and CMS Panhandle's FERC Gas Tariff, based upon an evaluation of requests for service and capital expenditures necessary to meet such requests.
PARTICIPATION IN THE OPEN SEASON  To participate in Columbia's open season, interested parties desiring service should submit a request, which includes the following items, by 4:30 p.m. E.T.
on Friday, December 14, 2001:  1.
One completed request form (attached), with specific attention to the    primary term of service, service commencement date, total capacity   requested, and the desired receipt and delivery point(s);  2.
One completed Credit Application Form (attached), to be submitted only by    interested parties that do not currently receive service from Columbia.
REQUEST FORM ASSESSMENT/FINALIZING SERVICE ARRANGEMENTS  Upon the close of the open season, Columbia will assess the requests for service.
Columbia will evaluate the system and capital requirements necessary to provide requested service and develop rates and terms and conditions of service based on the required system enhancements.
If, in Columbia's sole discretion, there is enough interest to justify going forward, Columbia will notify parties that submitted request forms as to their award of any existing or expansion capacity.
In the event requests for capacity exceed the amount of expansion capacity that Columbia can economically construct and make available, available expansion capacity will be allocated on a non-discriminatory basis.
All parties awarded capacity will be required to enter into binding precedent agreements and service agreements with Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and, if necessary, other transportation providers to complete the path.
Such agreements must be executed and returned to Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other transportation service providers, as deemed necessary, within a designated period of time; otherwise, an award of capacity will be subject to rejection.
All binding precedent agreements and service agreements entered into as a result of the open season must reflect an arm's-length transaction between the requesting party and Columbia, CMS Panhandle, and other transportation service providers, as deemed necessary.
Following the return of executed agreements, Columbia may reallocate any remaining available capacity (if any), but will not be obligated to do so.
During the open season, affiliates of Columbia shall be required to request capacity on the same basis as non-affiliates; that is, an affiliate's request shall be evaluated using the same criteria used to evaluate non-affiliates' requests.
To effectuate a seamless service for nomination and billing purposes, Shippers will name Columbia as agent for Shipper under any necessary upstream transportation agreements on CMS Panhandle.
RESERVATIONS  These procedures and the attached forms are provided solely to enable interested parties to submit a request for an award of capacity.
Neither this open season notice, the attachments herein, nor information provided in response to questions or requests about these procedures shall constitute an enforceable agreement.
Columbia reserves the right to not make any capacity available, to conduct additional open seasons, to determine the size, scope, and cost of the project, to not consider requests that do not provide a sufficient level of detail to aid in the development of a proposed project, and to reject or accept materials it receives after the close of the open season.

3362,"NGI's Daily Gas Price Index  Breaking News : posted Oct 2, 9:35 AM El Paso's Offshore Pipe From Nova Scotia To NY On Track  El Paso Corp. said Tuesday that because of increased drilling activity near Sable Island, it is on track to develop a $1.6 billion pipeline to transport natural gas supplies off the coast of Nova Scotia to markets in Canada and the northeastern part of the United States.
The proposed Blue Atlantic Transmission System, anticipated to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2005, would be 750 miles long, and its 36-inch pipe would carry up to 1 Bcf/d along a subsea route from the southern coast of Nova Scotia to landing points in New York and New Jersey.
Noting that El Paso was pleased with the initial feasibility study, E. Jay Holm, CEO of El Paso Eastern Pipeline Group, said the company was ""confident"" it could develop an effective plan.
Meanwhile, Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, the only existing system from offshore Nova Scotia to New England, has embarked on its own major expansion program designed to increase capacity on its system to 2 Bcf from 500 MMcf/d by 2010.
The Scotian Shelf currently has proven reserves of more than 6 Tcf, but experts believe it could contain 10 times that amount.
El Paso clearly has its eyes set on some of those volumes, but it will have battle with Maritimes, which already has commitments from the Sable Offshore Energy Project and PanCanadian Petroleum.
""The subsea configuration offers several advantages over a land-based alternative,"" said Holm, ""including minimal environmental impact, significant reduction in community disturbances, and anticipated transportation routes substantially less than $1 a dekatherm for firm deliveries to the New York and New Jersey markets, as well as reduced rates for deliveries to the province of Nova Scotia.""
Holm said that the ""anticipated rates are significantly less than that of any known current or proposed alternative project to provide firm transportation to these regions.""
Blue Atlantic would offer economic benefits to Nova Scotia by creating the first access to natural gas in the province's southwestern region and would address the ""continuing increasing demand"" for natural gas along the U.S. East Coast, said El Paso.
Natural gas demand along the East Coast is expected to increase an additional 685 MMcf/d by 2005, and will grow to an incremental 2 Bcf/d by the end of the decade.
El Paso plans to open an office in Halifax and has already retained Halifax-based Jacques Whitford Environment Ltd. as well as U.S.-based ENSR Corp. to begin the environmental work.
Also, El Paso is evaluating bids on providing overall project management services to assist in siting and design of the pipe and related facilities.
Soon, El Paso plans to enter into negotiations with potential shippers and conduct an open season to determine capacity demands before the end of this year.
It also is seeking input from various regulatory and government organizations, and is working with local communities involved and special interest groups to ensure issues are addressed about the project.
""This is an ambitious project and our goal is to identify various stakeholders and involve them during all phases of the development process,"" said Holm.
When the route has been selected, Blue Atlantic will proceed with obtaining the necessary approvals from both Canadian and U.S. regulatory officials, and El Paso said it expects filings will begin by the end of 2002.

3388,"Hello All-  Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.
The rate changes reflect under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism and increased cost of system fuel.
The underrecovery in the ASA account has increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 31.
Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in their 637 proceeding).
As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.
Texas Eastern proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the surcharge.

3390,"Mark-  Sorry for the delay in getting this to you...I've been struggling to find some more concrete information to rest an analysis on, but until we see Transco's supplemental testimony and the Commission Staff's ""top sheets"", it's very hard to predict where the case will come out.
Following, however, are some known variables that will effect the outcome of Transco's proposed increase:  Rate of Return on Equity  Transco filed for a 15.05% equity return (compared with the 12.4% recently affirmed by the FERC in the RP97-71 docket).
Transco based their filed number on a restructured ""proxy group"", which was revised by their witness to include Kinder Morgan, ElPaso Energy Partners, and Northern Border Partners (these were added to ElPaso, Enron and Williams).
Adding these entities has the effect of raising the high end of the range of DCF returns from 14.56& to 17.52% The effect of the 260 basis point increase to return on equity amounts to $61million, or approx.
27% of the requested increase.
Protests on this issue were filed chiefly by the New York PSC and PSE&G.
The NYPSC Protested mainly the change in the structure of the proxy group, citing the fact that the new entities added by Transco's witness are owned in substantial part by existing members of the proxy group.
The NYPSC asked for an expedited hearing on the development of a new proxy group--FERC declined to establish an expedited hearing but did set this issue for the hearing to be conducted before Judge Harfield.

3577,"James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.
I  don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.
He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.
The demand charge and  commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.
This is what we know about the  contract:  MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000 The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and  discounted demand of $6.08 If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61  What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for  volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November -   is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

He said it would be OK to net the storage true  up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.
I mailed the invoice via  interoffice to Jeff.
There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably  be billed to New Power.
All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.
How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?
Rich said it was his  understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
